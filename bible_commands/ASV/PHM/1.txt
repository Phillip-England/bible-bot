CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Philemon 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
LABEL:2
VERSE:and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
LABEL:5
VERSE:hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
LABEL:6
VERSE:that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,
LABEL:9
VERSE:yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:
LABEL:10
VERSE:I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
LABEL:11
VERSE:who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:
LABEL:12
VERSE:whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:
LABEL:13
VERSE:whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
LABEL:14
VERSE:but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;
LABEL:16
VERSE:no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
LABEL:17
VERSE:If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account;
LABEL:19
VERSE:I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;
LABEL:24
VERSE:and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
