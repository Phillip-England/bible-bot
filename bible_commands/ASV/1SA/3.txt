CHAPTER:3
TITLE:1 Samuel 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),
LABEL:3
VERSE:and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;
LABEL:4
VERSE:that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
LABEL:12
VERSE:In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliâ€™s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.
LABEL:19
VERSE:And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
LABEL:20
VERSE:And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.
LABEL:21
VERSE:And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.
