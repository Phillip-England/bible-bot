CHAPTER:1
TITLE:3 John 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;
LABEL:6
VERSE:who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:
LABEL:7
VERSE:because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
LABEL:8
VERSE:We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth them out of the church.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and thou knowest that our witness is true.
LABEL:13
VERSE:I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen:
LABEL:14
VERSE:but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
