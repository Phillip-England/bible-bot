TITLE:Revelation 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, a voice as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne;
LABEL:3
VERSE:and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;
LABEL:6
VERSE:and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.

VERSE:And the first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.

VERSE:And the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying,
VERSE:Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.

VERSE:Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power: for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created.
