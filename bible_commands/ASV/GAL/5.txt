CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Galatians 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?
LABEL:8
VERSE:This persuasion came not of him that calleth you.
LABEL:9
VERSE:A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
LABEL:20
VERSE:idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,
LABEL:21
VERSE:envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
LABEL:23
VERSE:meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.
LABEL:25
VERSE:If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
