CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Galatians 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),
LABEL:2
VERSE:and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
LABEL:4
VERSE:who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:
LABEL:5
VERSE:to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;
LABEL:7
VERSE:which is not another gospel: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.
LABEL:9
VERSE:As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:
LABEL:14
VERSE:and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,
LABEL:16
VERSE:to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:
LABEL:17
VERSE:neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.
LABEL:19
VERSE:But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
LABEL:22
VERSE:And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ:
LABEL:23
VERSE:but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;
LABEL:24
VERSE:and they glorified God in me.
