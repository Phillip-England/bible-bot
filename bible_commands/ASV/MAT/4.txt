VERSE:Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

VERSE:And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
LABEL:6
VERSE:and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written,
VERSE:He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:
VERSE:and,
VERSE:On their hands they shall bear thee up,
VERSE:Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
LABEL:9
VERSE:and he said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

VERSE:Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee;
LABEL:13
VERSE:and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:
LABEL:14
VERSE:that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
LABEL:15
VERSE:The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
VERSE:Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
VERSE:Galilee of the Gentiles,
LABEL:16
VERSE:The people that sat in darkness
VERSE:Saw a great light,
VERSE:And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,
VERSE:To them did light spring up.
LABEL:17
VERSE:From that time began Jesus to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

VERSE:And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.

VERSE:And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men.

VERSE:And they straightway left the nets, and followed him.
