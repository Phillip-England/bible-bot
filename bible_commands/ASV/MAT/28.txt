VERSE:Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

VERSE:And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.
LABEL:3
VERSE:His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
LABEL:4
VERSE:and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

VERSE:And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.

VERSE:And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.

VERSE:Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

VERSE:Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.

VERSE:And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.
