VERSE:For that the people offered themselves willingly,
VERSE:Bless ye Jehovah.

VERSE:Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes;
VERSE:I, even I, will sing unto Jehovah;
VERSE:I will sing praise to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Jehovah, when thou wentest forth out of Seir,
VERSE:When thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,
VERSE:The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,
VERSE:Yea, the clouds dropped water.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah,
VERSE:Even yon Sinai at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel.

VERSE:In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,

LABEL:7
VERSE:The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased,
VERSE:Until that I Deborah arose,
VERSE:That I arose a mother in Israel.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They chose new gods;
VERSE:Then was war in the gates:
VERSE:Was there a shield or spear seen
VERSE:Among forty thousand in Israel?
LABEL:9
VERSE:My heart is toward the governors of Israel,
VERSE:That offered themselves willingly among the people:
VERSE:Bless ye Jehovah.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Tell of it, ye that ride on white asses,
VERSE:Ye that sit on rich carpets,
VERSE:And ye that walk by the way.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,
VERSE:There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah,

LABEL:12
VERSE:Awake, awake, Deborah;
VERSE:Awake, awake, utter a song:
VERSE:Arise, Barak, and lead away thy captives, thou son of Abinoam.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Then came down a remnant of the nobles and the people;
VERSE:Jehovah came down for me against the mighty.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Out of Ephraim came down they whose root is in Amalek;
VERSE:After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples;
VERSE:Out of Machir came down governors,
VERSE:And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal’s staff.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
VERSE:As was Issachar, so was Barak;
VERSE:Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.
VERSE:By the watercourses of Reuben
VERSE:There were great resolves of heart.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds,
VERSE:To hear the pipings for the flocks?

VERSE:There were great searchings of heart.

VERSE:And abode by his creeks.

VERSE:Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death,
VERSE:And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.

VERSE:The kings came and fought;
VERSE:Then fought the kings of Canaan,
VERSE:In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo:
VERSE:They took no gain of money.
LABEL:20
VERSE:From heaven fought the stars,
VERSE:From their courses they fought against Sisera.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The river Kishon swept them away,
VERSE:That ancient river, the river Kishon.
VERSE:O my soul, march on with strength.

VERSE:By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.

VERSE:Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of Jehovah.

VERSE:Blessed above women shall Jael be,
VERSE:The wife of Heber the Kenite;

VERSE:He asked water, and she gave him milk;
VERSE:She brought him butter in a lordly dish.
LABEL:26
VERSE:She put her hand to the tent-pin,
VERSE:And her right hand to the workmen’s hammer;
VERSE:And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head;
VERSE:Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.
LABEL:27
VERSE:At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;
VERSE:At her feet he bowed, he fell:
VERSE:Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Through the window she looked forth, and cried,
VERSE:The mother of Sisera cried through the lattice,
VERSE:Why is his chariot so long in coming?
VERSE:Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
LABEL:29
VERSE:Her wise ladies answered her,
VERSE:Yea, she returned answer to herself,
LABEL:30
VERSE:Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?
VERSE:A damsel, two damsels to every man;
VERSE:To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,
VERSE:A spoil of dyed garments embroidered,
VERSE:Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
LABEL:31
VERSE:So let all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah:
VERSE:But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.
VERSE:And the land had rest forty years.
