VERSE:How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince’s daughter!
VERSE:Thy rounded thighs are like jewels,
VERSE:The work of the hands of a skilful workman.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thy body is like a round goblet,
VERSE:Wherein no mingled wine is wanting:
VERSE:Thy waist is like a heap of wheat
VERSE:Set about with lilies.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thy two breasts are like two fawns
VERSE:That are twins of a roe.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy neck is like the tower of ivory;
VERSE:Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon,
VERSE:By the gate of Bath-rabbim;
VERSE:Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon
VERSE:Which looketh toward Damascus.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thy head upon thee is like Carmel,
VERSE:And the hair of thy head like purple;
VERSE:The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.
LABEL:6
VERSE:How fair and how pleasant art thou,
VERSE:O love, for delights!
LABEL:7
VERSE:This thy stature is like to a palm-tree,
VERSE:And thy breasts to its clusters.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree,
VERSE:I will take hold of the branches thereof:
VERSE:Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine,
VERSE:And the smell of thy breath like apples,
LABEL:9
VERSE:And thy mouth like the best wine,
VERSE:That goeth down smoothly for my beloved,
VERSE:Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I am my beloved’s;
VERSE:And his desire is toward me.

VERSE:Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field;
VERSE:Let us lodge in the villages.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let us get up early to the vineyards;
VERSE:Let us see whether the vine hath budded,
VERSE:And its blossom is open,
VERSE:And the pomegranates are in flower:
VERSE:There will I give thee my love.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The mandrakes give forth fragrance;
VERSE:And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old,
VERSE:Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
