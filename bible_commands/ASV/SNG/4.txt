TITLE:Song of Solomon 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair;
VERSE:Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil.
VERSE:Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
VERSE:That lie along the side of mount Gilead.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn,
VERSE:Which are come up from the washing,
VERSE:Whereof every one hath twins,
VERSE:And none is bereaved among them.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,
VERSE:And thy mouth is comely.
VERSE:Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
VERSE:Behind thy veil.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy neck is like the tower of David
VERSE:Builded for an armory,
VERSE:Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
VERSE:All the shields of the mighty men.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thy two breasts are like two fawns
VERSE:That are twins of a roe,
VERSE:Which feed among the lilies.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away,
VERSE:I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,
VERSE:And to the hill of frankincense.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Thou art all fair, my love;
VERSE:And there is no spot in thee.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
VERSE:With me from Lebanon:
VERSE:Look from the top of Amana,
VERSE:From the top of Senir and Hermon,
VERSE:From the lionsâ€™ dens,
VERSE:From the mountains of the leopards.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride;
VERSE:Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
VERSE:With one chain of thy neck.
LABEL:10
VERSE:How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride!
VERSE:How much better is thy love than wine!
VERSE:And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!
LABEL:11
VERSE:Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb:
VERSE:Honey and milk are under thy tongue;
VERSE:And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
LABEL:12
VERSE:A garden shut up is my sister, my bride;
VERSE:A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits;
VERSE:Henna with spikenard plants,
LABEL:14
VERSE:Spikenard and saffron,
VERSE:Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense;
VERSE:Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
LABEL:15
VERSE:  Thou art a fountain of gardens,
VERSE:A well of living waters,
VERSE:And flowing streams from Lebanon.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south;
VERSE:Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.
VERSE:Let my beloved come into his garden,
VERSE:And eat his precious fruits.
