TITLE:Song of Solomon 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Oh that thou wert as my brother,
VERSE:That sucked the breasts of my mother!
VERSE:When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
VERSE:Yea, and none would despise me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I would lead thee, and bring thee into my motherâ€™s house,
VERSE:Who would instruct me;
VERSE:I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine,
VERSE:Of the juice of my pomegranate.
LABEL:3
VERSE:His left hand should be under my head,
VERSE:And his right hand should embrace me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
VERSE:That ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
VERSE:Until he please.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,
VERSE:Leaning upon her beloved?
VERSE:Under the apple-tree I awakened thee:
VERSE:There thy mother was in travail with thee,
VERSE:There was she in travail that brought thee forth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Set me as a seal upon thy heart,
VERSE:As a seal upon thine arm:
VERSE:For love is strong as death;
VERSE:Jealousy is cruel as Sheol;
VERSE:The flashes thereof are flashes of fire,
VERSE:A very flame of Jehovah.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Many waters cannot quench love,
VERSE:Neither can floods drown it:
VERSE:If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
VERSE:He would utterly be contemned.
LABEL:8
VERSE:We have a little sister,
VERSE:And she hath no breasts:
VERSE:What shall we do for our sister
VERSE:In the day when she shall be spoken for?
LABEL:9
VERSE:If she be a wall,
VERSE:We will build upon her a turret of silver:
VERSE:And if she be a door,
VERSE:We will inclose her with boards of cedar.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof:
VERSE:Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
VERSE:He let out the vineyard unto keepers;
VERSE:Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
LABEL:12
VERSE:My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
VERSE:Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand,
VERSE:And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
VERSE:The companions hearken for thy voice:
VERSE:Cause me to hear it.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Make haste, my beloved,
VERSE:And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart
VERSE:Upon the mountains of spices.
