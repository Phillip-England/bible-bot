CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Song of Solomon 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride:
VERSE:I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
VERSE:I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
VERSE:I have drunk my wine with my milk.
VERSE:Eat, O friends;
VERSE:Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I was asleep, but my heart waked:
VERSE:It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying,
VERSE:Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;
VERSE:For my head is filled with dew,
VERSE:My locks with the drops of the night.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on?
VERSE:I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
LABEL:4
VERSE:My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door,
VERSE:And my heart was moved for him.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I rose up to open to my beloved;
VERSE:And my hands dropped with myrrh,
VERSE:And my fingers with liquid myrrh,
VERSE:Upon the handles of the bolt.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I opened to my beloved;
VERSE:But my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone.
VERSE:My soul had failed me when he spake:
VERSE:I sought him, but I could not find him;
VERSE:I called him, but he gave me no answer.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The watchmen that go about the city found me,
VERSE:They smote me, they wounded me;
VERSE:The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
VERSE:If ye find my beloved,
VERSE:That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.
LABEL:9
VERSE:What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
VERSE:O thou fairest among women?
VERSE:What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
VERSE:That thou dost so adjure us?
LABEL:10
VERSE:My beloved is white and ruddy,
VERSE:The chiefest among ten thousand.
LABEL:11
VERSE:His head is as the most fine gold;
VERSE:His locks are bushy, and black as a raven.
LABEL:12
VERSE:His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks,
VERSE:Washed with milk, and fitly set.
LABEL:13
VERSE:His cheeks are as a bed of spices,
VERSE:As banks of sweet herbs:
VERSE:His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
LABEL:14
VERSE:His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl:
VERSE:His body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires.
LABEL:15
VERSE:His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:
VERSE:His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
LABEL:16
VERSE:His mouth is most sweet;
VERSE:Yea, he is altogether lovely.
VERSE:This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
VERSE:O daughters of Jerusalem.
