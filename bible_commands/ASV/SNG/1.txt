VERSE:Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
VERSE:For thy love is better than wine.

VERSE:Draw me; we will run after thee:

VERSE:As the tents of Kedar,
VERSE:As the curtains of Solomon.

VERSE:Look not upon me, because I am swarthy,
VERSE:Because the sun hath scorched me.

VERSE:Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth,
VERSE:Where thou feedest thy flock,
VERSE:Where thou makest it to rest at noon:
VERSE:For why should I be as one that is veiled
VERSE:Beside the flocks of thy companions?

VERSE:If thou know not, O thou fairest among women,
VERSE:Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
VERSE:And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.

VERSE:To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.

VERSE:We will make thee plaits of gold
VERSE:With studs of silver.

VERSE:While the king sat at his table,
VERSE:My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.
