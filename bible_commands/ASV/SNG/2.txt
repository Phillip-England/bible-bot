CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Song of Solomon 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:I am a rose of Sharon,
VERSE:A lily of the valleys.
LABEL:2
VERSE:As a lily among thorns,
VERSE:So is my love among the daughters.
LABEL:3
VERSE:As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood,
VERSE:So is my beloved among the sons.
VERSE:I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
VERSE:And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He brought me to the banqueting-house,
VERSE:And his banner over me was love.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Stay ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples;
VERSE:For I am sick from love.
LABEL:6
VERSE:His left hand is under my head,
VERSE:And his right hand doth embrace me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
VERSE:By the roes, or by the hinds of the field,
VERSE:That ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
VERSE:Until he please.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh,
VERSE:Leaping upon the mountains,
VERSE:Skipping upon the hills.
LABEL:9
VERSE:My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:
VERSE:Behold, he standeth behind our wall;
VERSE:He looketh in at the windows;
VERSE:He glanceth through the lattice.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My beloved spake, and said unto me,
VERSE:Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For, lo, the winter is past;
VERSE:The rain is over and gone;
LABEL:12
VERSE:The flowers appear on the earth;
VERSE:The time of the singing of birds is come,
VERSE:And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;
LABEL:13
VERSE:The fig-tree ripeneth her green figs,
VERSE:And the vines are in blossom;
VERSE:They give forth their fragrance.
VERSE:Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
LABEL:14
VERSE:O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock,
VERSE:In the covert of the steep place,
VERSE:Let me see thy countenance,
VERSE:Let me hear thy voice;
VERSE:For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Take us the foxes, the little foxes,
VERSE:That spoil the vineyards;
VERSE:For our vineyards are in blossom.
LABEL:16
VERSE:My beloved is mine, and I am his:
VERSE:He feedeth his flock among the lilies.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away,
VERSE:Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart
VERSE:Upon the mountains of Bether.
