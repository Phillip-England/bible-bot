VERSE:Whither is thy beloved gone,
VERSE:O thou fairest among women?
VERSE:Whither hath thy beloved turned him,
VERSE:That we may seek him with thee?

VERSE:My beloved is gone down to his garden,
VERSE:To the beds of spices,

VERSE:I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine:
VERSE:He feedeth his flock among the lilies.

VERSE:Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah,
VERSE:Comely as Jerusalem,
VERSE:Terrible as an army with banners.

VERSE:Turn away thine eyes from me,
VERSE:For they have overcome me.
VERSE:Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
VERSE:That lie along the side of Gilead.

VERSE:Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes,
VERSE:Which are come up from the washing;
VERSE:Whereof every one hath twins,
VERSE:And none is bereaved among them.

VERSE:Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
VERSE:Behind thy veil.

VERSE:And virgins without number.

VERSE:My dove, my undefiled, is but one;
VERSE:She is the only one of her mother;
VERSE:She is the choice one of her that bare her.
VERSE:The daughters saw her, and called her blessed;
VERSE:Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

VERSE:Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,
VERSE:Fair as the moon,
VERSE:Clear as the sun,
VERSE:Terrible as an army with banners?

VERSE:I went down into the garden of nuts,
VERSE:To see the green plants of the valley,
VERSE:To see whether the vine budded,
VERSE:And the pomegranates were in flower.

VERSE:Before I was aware, my soul set me
VERSE:Among the chariots of my princely people.

VERSE:Return, return, O Shulammite;
VERSE:Return, return, that we may look upon thee.
VERSE:Why will ye look upon the Shulammite,
VERSE:As upon the dance of Mahanaim?
