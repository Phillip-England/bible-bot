VERSE:And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.

VERSE:And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.

VERSE:And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:
LABEL:5
VERSE:Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
LABEL:6
VERSE:and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
LABEL:8
VERSE:O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name;
VERSE:Make known his doings among the peoples.

VERSE:O ye seed of Israel his servant,
VERSE:Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He is Jehovah our God;
VERSE:His judgments are in all the earth.

VERSE:Remember his covenant for ever,
VERSE:The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
LABEL:16

VERSE:And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute,
VERSE:To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
LABEL:18
VERSE:Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
VERSE:The lot of your inheritance;
LABEL:19
VERSE:When ye were but a few men in number,
VERSE:Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;
LABEL:20
VERSE:And they went about from nation to nation,
VERSE:And from one kingdom to another people.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He suffered no man to do them wrong;
VERSE:Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
LABEL:22
VERSE:  Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones,

VERSE:For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised:
VERSE:He also is to be feared above all gods.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For all the gods of the peoples are idols:
VERSE:But Jehovah made the heavens.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Honor and majesty are before him:
VERSE:Strength and gladness are in his place.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples,
VERSE:Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;

VERSE:Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name:
VERSE:Bring an offering, and come before him;
VERSE:Worship Jehovah in holy array.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Tremble before him, all the earth:
VERSE:The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
VERSE:And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
VERSE:Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
LABEL:33
VERSE:Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah;
VERSE:For he cometh to judge the earth.
LABEL:34
VERSE:O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good;
VERSE:For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
LABEL:35
VERSE:And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation,
VERSE:And gather us together and deliver us from the nations,
VERSE:To give thanks unto thy holy name,
VERSE:And to triumph in thy praise.
LABEL:36
VERSE:Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
VERSE:From everlasting even to everlasting.

VERSE:and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;

VERSE:and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,
LABEL:40
VERSE:to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;
LABEL:41
VERSE:and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
LABEL:42
VERSE:and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.
LABEL:43
VERSE:And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
