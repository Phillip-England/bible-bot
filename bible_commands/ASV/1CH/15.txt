VERSE:and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For because ye bare it not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.

VERSE:So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed, with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;

VERSE:And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

LABEL:29
VERSE:And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.
