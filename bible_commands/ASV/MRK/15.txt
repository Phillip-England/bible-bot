TITLE:Mark 15
LABEL:1
VERSE:And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And the chief priests accused him of many things.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
LABEL:10
VERSE:For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
LABEL:13
VERSE:And they cried out again, Crucify him.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Prætorium; and they call together the whole band.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;
LABEL:18
VERSE:and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
LABEL:19
VERSE:And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
LABEL:20
VERSE:And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.
LABEL:21
VERSE:And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.
LABEL:22
VERSE:And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.
LABEL:25
VERSE:And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
LABEL:27
VERSE:And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
LABEL:28
VERSE:
LABEL:29
VERSE:And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
LABEL:30
VERSE:save thyself, and come down from the cross.
LABEL:31
VERSE:In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.
LABEL:33
VERSE:And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
LABEL:34
VERSE:And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
LABEL:35
VERSE:And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.
LABEL:36
VERSE:And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.
LABEL:37
VERSE:And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
LABEL:38
VERSE:And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
LABEL:39
VERSE:And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
LABEL:40
VERSE:And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
LABEL:41
VERSE:who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.
LABEL:42
VERSE:And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
LABEL:43
VERSE:there came Joseph of Arimathæa, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
LABEL:44
VERSE:And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
LABEL:45
VERSE:And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
LABEL:46
VERSE:And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
LABEL:47
VERSE:And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
