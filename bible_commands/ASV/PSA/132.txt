TITLE:Psalms 132
LABEL:1
VERSE:Jehovah, remember for David
VERSE:All his affliction;
LABEL:2
VERSE:How he sware unto Jehovah,
VERSE:And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house,
VERSE:Nor go up into my bed;
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will not give sleep to mine eyes,
VERSE:Or slumber to mine eyelids;
LABEL:5
VERSE:Until I find out a place for Jehovah,
VERSE:A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah:
VERSE:We found it in the field of the wood.
LABEL:7
VERSE:We will go into his tabernacles;
VERSE:We will worship at his footstool.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Arise, O Jehovah, into thy resting-place;
VERSE:Thou, and the ark of thy strength.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
VERSE:And let thy saints shout for joy.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For thy servant Davidâ€™s sake
VERSE:Turn not away the face of thine anointed.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Jehovah hath sworn unto David in truth;
VERSE:He will not turn from it:
VERSE:Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If thy children will keep my covenant
VERSE:And my testimony that I shall teach them,
VERSE:Their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For Jehovah hath chosen Zion;
VERSE:He hath desired it for his habitation.
LABEL:14
VERSE:This is my resting-place for ever:
VERSE:Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I will abundantly bless her provision:
VERSE:I will satisfy her poor with bread.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Her priests also will I clothe with salvation;
VERSE:And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
LABEL:17
VERSE:There will I make the horn of David to bud:
VERSE:I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
LABEL:18
VERSE:His enemies will I clothe with shame;
VERSE:But upon himself shall his crown flourish.
