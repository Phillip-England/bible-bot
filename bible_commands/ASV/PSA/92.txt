TITLE:Psalms 92
LABEL:1
VERSE:It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah,
VERSE:And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High;
LABEL:2
VERSE:To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning,
VERSE:And thy faithfulness every night,
LABEL:3
VERSE:With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery;
VERSE:With a solemn sound upon the harp.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work:
VERSE:I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
LABEL:5
VERSE:How great are thy works, O Jehovah!
VERSE:Thy thoughts are very deep.
LABEL:6
VERSE:A brutish man knoweth not;
VERSE:Neither doth a fool understand this:
LABEL:7
VERSE:When the wicked spring as the grass,
VERSE:And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
VERSE:It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah,
VERSE:For, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
VERSE:All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox:
VERSE:I am anointed with fresh oil.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies,
VERSE:Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree:
VERSE:He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

VERSE:They are planted in the house of Jehovah;
VERSE:They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
VERSE:They shall be full of sap and green:
LABEL:15
VERSE:To show that Jehovah is upright;
VERSE:He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
