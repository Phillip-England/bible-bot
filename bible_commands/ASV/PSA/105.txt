TITLE:Psalms 105
LABEL:1
VERSE:Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name;
VERSE:Make known among the peoples his doings.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;
VERSE:Talk ye of all his marvellous works.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Glory ye in his holy name:
VERSE:Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Seek ye Jehovah and his strength;
VERSE:Seek his face evermore.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Remember his marvellous works that he hath done,
VERSE:His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
LABEL:6
VERSE:O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
VERSE:Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He is Jehovah our God:
VERSE:His judgments are in all the earth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
VERSE:The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
LABEL:9
VERSE:  The covenant which he made with Abraham,
VERSE:And his oath unto Isaac,
LABEL:10
VERSE:And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute,
VERSE:To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
LABEL:11
VERSE:Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
VERSE:The lot of your inheritance;
LABEL:12
VERSE:When they were but a few men in number,
VERSE:Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And they went about from nation to nation,
VERSE:From one kingdom to another people.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He suffered no man to do them wrong;
VERSE:Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
LABEL:15
VERSE:  Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones,
VERSE:And do my prophets no harm.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And he called for a famine upon the land;
VERSE:He brake the whole staff of bread.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He sent a man before them;
VERSE:Joseph was sold for a servant:
LABEL:18
VERSE:His feet they hurt with fetters:
VERSE:He was laid in chains of iron,
LABEL:19
VERSE:Until the time that his word came to pass,
VERSE:The word of Jehovah tried him.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The king sent and loosed him;
VERSE:Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He made him lord of his house,
VERSE:And ruler of all his substance;
LABEL:22
VERSE:To bind his princes at his pleasure,
VERSE:And teach his elders wisdom.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Israel also came into Egypt;
VERSE:And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And he increased his people greatly,
VERSE:And made them stronger than their adversaries.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He turned their heart to hate his people,
VERSE:To deal subtly with his servants.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He sent Moses his servant,
VERSE:And Aaron whom he had chosen.
LABEL:27
VERSE:They set among them his signs,
VERSE:And wonders in the land of Ham.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He sent darkness, and made it dark;
VERSE:And they rebelled not against his words.
LABEL:29
VERSE:He turned their waters into blood,
VERSE:And slew their fish.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Their land swarmed with frogs
VERSE:In the chambers of their kings.
LABEL:31
VERSE:He spake, and there came swarms of flies,
VERSE:And lice in all their borders.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He gave them hail for rain,
VERSE:And flaming fire in their land.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He smote their vines also and their fig-trees,
VERSE:And brake the trees of their borders.
LABEL:34
VERSE:He spake, and the locust came,
VERSE:And the grasshopper, and that without number,
LABEL:35
VERSE:And did eat up every herb in their land,
VERSE:And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
LABEL:36
VERSE:He smote also all the first-born in their land,
VERSE:The chief of all their strength.
LABEL:37
VERSE:And he brought them forth with silver and gold;
VERSE:And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
LABEL:38
VERSE:Egypt was glad when they departed;
VERSE:For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
LABEL:39
VERSE:He spread a cloud for a covering,
VERSE:And fire to give light in the night.
LABEL:40
VERSE:They asked, and he brought quails,
VERSE:And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
LABEL:41
VERSE:He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;
VERSE:They ran in the dry places like a river.
LABEL:42
VERSE:For he remembered his holy word,
VERSE:And Abraham his servant.
LABEL:43
VERSE:And he brought forth his people with joy,
VERSE:And his chosen with singing.
LABEL:44
VERSE:And he gave them the lands of the nations;
VERSE:And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
LABEL:45
VERSE:That they might keep his statutes,
VERSE:And observe his laws.
VERSE:Praise ye Jehovah.
