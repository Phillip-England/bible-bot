TITLE:Psalms 83
LABEL:1
VERSE:O God, keep not thou silence:
VERSE:Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult;
VERSE:And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They take crafty counsel against thy people,
VERSE:And consult together against thy hidden ones.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
VERSE:That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For they have consulted together with one consent;
VERSE:Against thee do they make a covenant:
LABEL:6
VERSE:The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
VERSE:Moab, and the Hagarenes;
LABEL:7
VERSE:Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;
VERSE:Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
LABEL:8
VERSE:Assyria also is joined with them;
VERSE:They have helped the children of Lot. [Selah
LABEL:9
VERSE:Do thou unto them as unto Midian,
VERSE:As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
LABEL:10
VERSE:Who perished at Endor,
VERSE:Who became as dung for the earth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
VERSE:Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
LABEL:12
VERSE:Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession
VERSE:The habitations of God.
LABEL:13
VERSE:O my God, make them like the whirling dust;
VERSE:As stubble before the wind.
LABEL:14
VERSE:As the fire that burneth the forest,
VERSE:And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,
LABEL:15
VERSE:So pursue them with thy tempest,
VERSE:And terrify them with thy storm.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Fill their faces with confusion,
VERSE:That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever;
VERSE:Yea, let them be confounded and perish;
LABEL:18
VERSE:That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah,
VERSE:Art the Most High over all the earth.
