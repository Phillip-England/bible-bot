CHAPTER:78
TITLE:Psalms 78
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear, O my people, to my law:
VERSE:Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I will open my mouth in a parable;
VERSE:I will utter dark sayings of old,
LABEL:3
VERSE:Which we have heard and known,
VERSE:And our fathers have told us.
LABEL:4
VERSE:We will not hide them from their children,
VERSE:Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah,
VERSE:And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For he established a testimony in Jacob,
VERSE:And appointed a law in Israel,
VERSE:Which he commanded our fathers,
VERSE:That they should make them known to their children;
LABEL:6
VERSE:That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born;
VERSE:Who should arise and tell them to their children,
LABEL:7
VERSE:That they might set their hope in God,
VERSE:And not forget the works of God,
VERSE:But keep his commandments,
LABEL:8
VERSE:And might not be as their fathers,
VERSE:A stubborn and rebellious generation,
VERSE:A generation that set not their heart aright,
VERSE:And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
VERSE:Turned back in the day of battle.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They kept not the covenant of God,
VERSE:And refused to walk in his law;
LABEL:11
VERSE:And they forgat his doings,
VERSE:And his wondrous works that he had showed them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers,
VERSE:In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through;
VERSE:And he made the waters to stand as a heap.
LABEL:14
VERSE:In the day-time also he led them with a cloud,
VERSE:And all the night with a light of fire.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He clave rocks in the wilderness,
VERSE:And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He brought streams also out of the rock,
VERSE:And caused waters to run down like rivers.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Yet went they on still to sin against him,
VERSE:To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And they tempted God in their heart
VERSE:By asking food according to their desire.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Yea, they spake against God;
VERSE:They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out,
VERSE:And streams overflowed;
VERSE:Can he give bread also?
VERSE:Will he provide flesh for his people?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth;
VERSE:And a fire was kindled against Jacob,
VERSE:And anger also went up against Israel;
LABEL:22
VERSE:Because they believed not in God,
VERSE:And trusted not in his salvation.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Yet he commanded the skies above,
VERSE:And opened the doors of heaven;
LABEL:24
VERSE:And he rained down manna upon them to eat,
VERSE:And gave them food from heaven.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Man did eat the bread of the mighty:
VERSE:He sent them food to the full.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens;
VERSE:And by his power he guided the south wind.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He rained flesh also upon them as the dust,
VERSE:And winged birds as the sand of the seas:
LABEL:28
VERSE:And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,
VERSE:Round about their habitations.
LABEL:29
VERSE:So they did eat, and were well filled;
VERSE:And he gave them their own desire.
LABEL:30
VERSE:They were not estranged from that which they desired,
VERSE:Their food was yet in their mouths,
LABEL:31
VERSE:When the anger of God went up against them,
VERSE:And slew of the fattest of them,
VERSE:And smote down the young men of Israel.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For all this they sinned still,
VERSE:And believed not in his wondrous works.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
VERSE:And their years in terror.
LABEL:34
VERSE:When he slew them, then they inquired after him;
VERSE:And they returned and sought God earnestly.
LABEL:35
VERSE:And they remembered that God was their rock,
VERSE:And the Most High God their redeemer.
LABEL:36
VERSE:But they flattered him with their mouth,
VERSE:And lied unto him with their tongue.
LABEL:37
VERSE:For their heart was not right with him,
VERSE:Neither were they faithful in his covenant.
LABEL:38
VERSE:But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not:
VERSE:Yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
VERSE:And did not stir up all his wrath.
LABEL:39
VERSE:And he remembered that they were but flesh,
VERSE:A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
LABEL:40
VERSE:How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness,
VERSE:And grieve him in the desert!
LABEL:41
VERSE:And they turned again and tempted God,
VERSE:And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:42
VERSE:They remembered not his hand,
VERSE:Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
LABEL:43
VERSE:How he set his signs in Egypt,
VERSE:And his wonders in the field of Zoan,
LABEL:44
VERSE:And turned their rivers into blood,
VERSE:And their streams, so that they could not drink.
LABEL:45
VERSE:He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
VERSE:And frogs, which destroyed them.
LABEL:46
VERSE:He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar,
VERSE:And their labor unto the locust.
LABEL:47
VERSE:He destroyed their vines with hail,
VERSE:And their sycomore-trees with frost.
LABEL:48
VERSE:He gave over their cattle also to the hail,
VERSE:And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
LABEL:49
VERSE:He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,
VERSE:Wrath, and indignation, and trouble,
VERSE:A band of angels of evil.
LABEL:50
VERSE:He made a path for his anger;
VERSE:He spared not their soul from death,
VERSE:But gave their life over to the pestilence,
LABEL:51
VERSE:And smote all the first-born in Egypt,
VERSE:The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
LABEL:52
VERSE:But he led forth his own people like sheep,
VERSE:And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
LABEL:53
VERSE:And he led them safely, so that they feared not;
VERSE:But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
LABEL:54
VERSE:And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
VERSE:To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.
LABEL:55
VERSE:He drove out the nations also before them,
VERSE:And allotted them for an inheritance by line,
VERSE:And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
LABEL:56
VERSE:Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,
VERSE:And kept not his testimonies;
LABEL:57
VERSE:But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:
VERSE:They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
LABEL:58
VERSE:For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
VERSE:And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
LABEL:59
VERSE:When God heard this, he was wroth,
VERSE:And greatly abhorred Israel;
LABEL:60
VERSE:So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
VERSE:The tent which he placed among men;
LABEL:61
VERSE:And delivered his strength into captivity,
VERSE:And his glory into the adversaryâ€™s hand.
LABEL:62
VERSE:He gave his people over also unto the sword,
VERSE:And was wroth with his inheritance.
LABEL:63
VERSE:Fire devoured their young men;
VERSE:And their virgins had no marriage-song.
LABEL:64
VERSE:Their priests fell by the sword;
VERSE:And their widows made no lamentation.
LABEL:65
VERSE:Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
VERSE:Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
LABEL:66
VERSE:And he smote his adversaries backward:
VERSE:He put them to a perpetual reproach.
LABEL:67
VERSE:Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph,
VERSE:And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
LABEL:68
VERSE:But chose the tribe of Judah,
VERSE:The mount Zion which he loved.
LABEL:69
VERSE:And he built his sanctuary like the heights,
VERSE:Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
LABEL:70
VERSE:He chose David also his servant,
VERSE:And took him from the sheepfolds:
LABEL:71
VERSE:From following the ewes that have their young he brought him,
VERSE:To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
LABEL:72
VERSE:So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,
VERSE:And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
