CHAPTER:88
TITLE:Psalms 88
LABEL:1
VERSE:O Jehovah, the God of my salvation,
VERSE:I have cried day and night before thee.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let my prayer enter into thy presence;
VERSE:Incline thine ear unto my cry.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For my soul is full of troubles,
VERSE:And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit;
VERSE:I am as a man that hath no help,
LABEL:5
VERSE:Cast off among the dead,
VERSE:Like the slain that lie in the grave,
VERSE:Whom thou rememberest no more,
VERSE:And they are cut off from thy hand.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,
VERSE:In dark places, in the deeps.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,
VERSE:And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. [Selah
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me;
VERSE:Thou hast made me an abomination unto them:
VERSE:I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction:
VERSE:I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah;
VERSE:I have spread forth my hands unto thee.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?
VERSE:Shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? [Selah
LABEL:11
VERSE:Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?
VERSE:Or thy faithfulness in Destruction?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
VERSE:And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
LABEL:13
VERSE:But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried;
VERSE:And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul?
VERSE:Why hidest thou thy face from me?
LABEL:15
VERSE:I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up:
VERSE:While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Thy fierce wrath is gone over me;
VERSE:Thy terrors have cut me off.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They came round about me like water all the day long;
VERSE:They compassed me about together.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,
VERSE:And mine acquaintance into darkness.
