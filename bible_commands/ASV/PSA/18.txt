CHAPTER:18
TITLE:Psalms 18
LABEL:1
VERSE:I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
VERSE:My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge;
VERSE:My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised:
VERSE:So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The cords of death compassed me,
VERSE:And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The cords of Sheol were round about me;
VERSE:The snares of death came upon me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In my distress I called upon Jehovah,
VERSE:And cried unto my God:
VERSE:He heard my voice out of his temple,
VERSE:And my cry before him came into his ears.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Then the earth shook and trembled;
VERSE:The foundations also of the mountains quaked
VERSE:And were shaken, because he was wroth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
VERSE:And fire out of his mouth devoured:
VERSE:Coals were kindled by it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
VERSE:And thick darkness was under his feet.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;
VERSE:Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him,
VERSE:Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
LABEL:12
VERSE:At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
VERSE:Hailstones and coals of fire.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Jehovah also thundered in the heavens,
VERSE:And the Most High uttered his voice,
VERSE:Hailstones and coals of fire.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
VERSE:Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then the channels of waters appeared,
VERSE:And the foundations of the world were laid bare,
VERSE:At thy rebuke, O Jehovah,
VERSE:At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He sent from on high, he took me;
VERSE:He drew me out of many waters.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He delivered me from my strong enemy,
VERSE:And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They came upon me in the day of my calamity;
VERSE:But Jehovah was my stay.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He brought me forth also into a large place;
VERSE:He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness;
VERSE:According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,
VERSE:And have not wickedly departed from my God.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For all his ordinances were before me,
VERSE:And I put not away his statutes from me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I was also perfect with him,
VERSE:And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,
VERSE:According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
LABEL:25
VERSE:With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful;
VERSE:With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
LABEL:26
VERSE:With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure;
VERSE:And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
VERSE:But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For thou wilt light my lamp:
VERSE:Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.
LABEL:29
VERSE:For by thee I run upon a troop;
VERSE:And by my God do I leap over a wall.
LABEL:30
VERSE:As for God, his way is perfect:
VERSE:The word of Jehovah is tried;
VERSE:He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For who is God, save Jehovah?
VERSE:And who is a rock, besides our God,
LABEL:32
VERSE:The God that girdeth me with strength,
VERSE:And maketh my way perfect?
LABEL:33
VERSE:He maketh my feet like hindsâ€™ feet:
VERSE:And setteth me upon my high places.
LABEL:34
VERSE:He teacheth my hands to war;
VERSE:So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation;
VERSE:And thy right hand hath holden me up,
VERSE:And thy gentleness hath made me great.
LABEL:36
VERSE:Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
VERSE:And my feet have not slipped.
LABEL:37
VERSE:I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them;
VERSE:Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.
LABEL:38
VERSE:I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise:
VERSE:They shall fall under my feet.
LABEL:39
VERSE:For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle:
VERSE:Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,
VERSE:That I might cut off them that hate me.
LABEL:41
VERSE:They cried, but there was none to save;
VERSE:Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind;
VERSE:I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;
VERSE:Thou hast made me the head of the nations:
VERSE:A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
LABEL:44
VERSE:As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me;
VERSE:The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.
LABEL:45
VERSE:The foreigners shall fade away,
VERSE:And shall come trembling out of their close places.
LABEL:46
VERSE:Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock;
VERSE:And exalted be the God of my salvation,
LABEL:47
VERSE:Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,
VERSE:And subdueth peoples under me.
LABEL:48
VERSE:He rescueth me from mine enemies;
VERSE:Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;
VERSE:Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
LABEL:49
VERSE:Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations,
VERSE:And will sing praises unto thy name.
LABEL:50
VERSE:Great deliverance giveth he to his king,
VERSE:And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed,
VERSE:To David and to his seed, for evermore.
