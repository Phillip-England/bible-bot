CHAPTER:17
TITLE:Psalms 17
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry;
VERSE:Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
VERSE:Let thine eyes look upon equity.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night;
VERSE:Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing;
VERSE:I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
LABEL:4
VERSE:As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips
VERSE:I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
LABEL:5
VERSE:My steps have held fast to thy paths,
VERSE:My feet have not slipped.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God:
VERSE:Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Show thy marvellous lovingkindness,
VERSE:O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge in thee
VERSE:From those that rise up against them.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Keep me as the apple of the eye;
VERSE:Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
LABEL:9
VERSE:From the wicked that oppress me,
VERSE:My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They are inclosed in their own fat:
VERSE:With their mouth they speak proudly.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They have now compassed us in our steps;
VERSE:They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,
VERSE:And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Arise, O Jehovah,
VERSE:Confront him, cast him down:
VERSE:Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;
LABEL:14
VERSE:From men by thy hand, O Jehovah,
VERSE:From men of the world, whose portion is in this life,
VERSE:And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure:
VERSE:They are satisfied with children,
VERSE:And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
LABEL:15
VERSE:As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness;
VERSE:I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.
