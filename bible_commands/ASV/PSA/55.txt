CHAPTER:55
TITLE:Psalms 55
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear to my prayer, O God;
VERSE:And hide not thyself from my supplication.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Attend unto me, and answer me:
VERSE:I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
LABEL:3
VERSE:Because of the voice of the enemy,
VERSE:Because of the oppression of the wicked;
VERSE:For they cast iniquity upon me,
VERSE:And in anger they persecute me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:My heart is sore pained within me:
VERSE:And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
VERSE:And horror hath overwhelmed me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!
VERSE:Then would I fly away, and be at rest.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Lo, then would I wander far off,
VERSE:I would lodge in the wilderness. [Selah
LABEL:8
VERSE:I would haste me to a shelter
VERSE:From the stormy wind and tempest.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue;
VERSE:For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
VERSE:Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Wickedness is in the midst thereof:
VERSE:Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
VERSE:Then I could have borne it:
VERSE:Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me;
VERSE:Then I would have hid myself from him:
LABEL:13
VERSE:But it was thou, a man mine equal,
VERSE:My companion, and my familiar friend.
LABEL:14
VERSE:We took sweet counsel together;
VERSE:We walked in the house of God with the throng.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let death come suddenly upon them,
VERSE:Let them go down alive into Sheol;
VERSE:For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
LABEL:16
VERSE:As for me, I will call upon God;
VERSE:And Jehovah will save me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan;
VERSE:And he will hear my voice.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me;
VERSE:For they were many that strove with me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:God will hear, and answer them,
VERSE:Even he that abideth of old, [Selah
VERSE:The men who have no changes,
VERSE:And who fear not God.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him:
VERSE:He hath profaned his covenant.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His mouth was smooth as butter,
VERSE:But his heart was war:
VERSE:His words were softer than oil,
VERSE:Yet were they drawn swords.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee:
VERSE:He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.
LABEL:23
VERSE:But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
VERSE:Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
VERSE:But I will trust in thee.
