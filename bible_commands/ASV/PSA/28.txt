CHAPTER:28
TITLE:Psalms 28
LABEL:1
VERSE:Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call:
VERSE:My rock, be not thou deaf unto me;
VERSE:Lest, if thou be silent unto me,
VERSE:I become like them that go down into the pit.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,
VERSE:When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Draw me not away with the wicked,
VERSE:And with the workers of iniquity;
VERSE:That speak peace with their neighbors,
VERSE:But mischief is in their hearts.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings:
VERSE:Give them after the operation of their hands;
VERSE:Render to them their desert.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Because they regard not the works of Jehovah,
VERSE:Nor the operation of his hands,
VERSE:He will break them down and not build them up.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Blessed be Jehovah,
VERSE:Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Jehovah is my strength and my shield;
VERSE:My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped:
VERSE:Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
VERSE:And with my song will I praise him.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Jehovah is their strength,
VERSE:And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance:
VERSE:Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.
