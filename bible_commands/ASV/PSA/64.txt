CHAPTER:64
TITLE:Psalms 64
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint:
VERSE:Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers,
VERSE:From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;
LABEL:3
VERSE:Who have whet their tongue like a sword,
VERSE:And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,
LABEL:4
VERSE:That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect:
VERSE:Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They encourage themselves in an evil purpose;
VERSE:They commune of laying snares privily;
VERSE:They say, Who will see them?
LABEL:6
VERSE:They search out iniquities;
VERSE:We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search:
VERSE:And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But God will shoot at them;
VERSE:With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.
LABEL:8
VERSE:So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them:
VERSE:All that see them shall wag the head.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And all men shall fear;
VERSE:And they shall declare the work of God,
VERSE:And shall wisely consider of his doing.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him;
VERSE:And all the upright in heart shall glory.
