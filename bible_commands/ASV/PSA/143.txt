TITLE:Psalms 143
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; give ear to my supplications:
VERSE:In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And enter not into judgment with thy servant;
VERSE:For in thy sight no man living is righteous.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
VERSE:He hath smitten my life down to the ground:
VERSE:He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me;
VERSE:My heart within me is desolate.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I remember the days of old;
VERSE:I meditate on all thy doings;
VERSE:I muse on the work of thy hands.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I spread forth my hands unto thee:
VERSE:My soul thirsteth after thee, as a weary land. [Selah
LABEL:7
VERSE:Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; my spirit faileth:
VERSE:Hide not thy face from me,
VERSE:Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning;
VERSE:For in thee do I trust:
VERSE:Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
VERSE:For I lift up my soul unto thee.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies:
VERSE:I flee unto thee to hide me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Teach me to do thy will;
VERSE:For thou art my God:
VERSE:Thy Spirit is good;
VERSE:Lead me in the land of uprightness.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Quicken me, O Jehovah, for thy nameâ€™s sake:
VERSE:In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
LABEL:12
VERSE:And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies,
VERSE:And destroy all them that afflict my soul;
VERSE:For I am thy servant.
