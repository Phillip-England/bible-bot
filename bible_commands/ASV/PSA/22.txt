CHAPTER:22
TITLE:Psalms 22
LABEL:1
VERSE:My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
VERSE:Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?
LABEL:2
VERSE:O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not;
VERSE:And in the night season, and am not silent.
LABEL:3
VERSE:But thou art holy,
VERSE:O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Our fathers trusted in thee:
VERSE:They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They cried unto thee, and were delivered:
VERSE:They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.
LABEL:6
VERSE:But I am a worm, and no man;
VERSE:A reproach of men, and despised of the people.
LABEL:7
VERSE:All they that see me laugh me to scorn:
VERSE:They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
LABEL:8
VERSE:Commit thyself unto Jehovah; let him deliver him:
VERSE:Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.
LABEL:9
VERSE:But thou art he that took me out of the womb;
VERSE:Thou didst make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I was cast upon thee from the womb;
VERSE:Thou art my God since my mother bare me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Be not far from me; for trouble is near;
VERSE:For there is none to help.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Many bulls have compassed me;
VERSE:Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They gape upon me with their mouth,
VERSE:As a ravening and a roaring lion.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I am poured out like water,
VERSE:And all my bones are out of joint:
VERSE:My heart is like wax;
VERSE:It is melted within me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My strength is dried up like a potsherd;
VERSE:And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws;
VERSE:And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For dogs have compassed me:
VERSE:A company of evil-doers have inclosed me;
VERSE:They pierced my hands and my feet.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I may count all my bones.
VERSE:They look and stare upon me;
LABEL:18
VERSE:They part my garments among them,
VERSE:And upon my vesture do they cast lots.
LABEL:19
VERSE:But be not thou far off, O Jehovah:
VERSE:O thou my succor, haste thee to help me.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Deliver my soul from the sword,
VERSE:My darling from the power of the dog.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Save me from the lion’s mouth;
VERSE:Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:I will declare thy name unto my brethren:
VERSE:In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him;
VERSE:All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him;
VERSE:And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.
LABEL:24
VERSE:For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted;
VERSE:Neither hath he hid his face from him;
VERSE:But when he cried unto him, he heard.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly:
VERSE:I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The meek shall eat and be satisfied;
VERSE:They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him:
VERSE:Let your heart live for ever.
LABEL:27
VERSE:All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah;
VERSE:And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For the kingdom is Jehovah’s;
VERSE:And he is the ruler over the nations.
LABEL:29
VERSE:All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship:
VERSE:All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him,
VERSE:Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.
LABEL:30
VERSE:A seed shall serve him;
VERSE:It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.
LABEL:31
VERSE:They shall come and shall declare his righteousness
VERSE:Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.
