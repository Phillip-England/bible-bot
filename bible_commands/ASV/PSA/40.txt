CHAPTER:40
TITLE:Psalms 40
LABEL:1
VERSE:I waited patiently for Jehovah;
VERSE:And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay;
VERSE:And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:
VERSE:Many shall see it, and fear,
VERSE:And shall trust in Jehovah.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah his trust,
VERSE:And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done,
VERSE:And thy thoughts which are to us-ward:
VERSE:They cannot be set in order unto thee;
VERSE:If I would declare and speak of them,
VERSE:They are more than can be numbered.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in;
VERSE:Mine ears hast thou opened:
VERSE:Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Then said I, Lo, I am come;
VERSE:In the roll of the book it is written of me:
LABEL:8
VERSE:I delight to do thy will, O my God;
VERSE:Yea, thy law is within my heart.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly;
VERSE:Lo, I will not refrain my lips,
VERSE:O Jehovah, thou knowest.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart;
VERSE:I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation;
VERSE:I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah;
VERSE:Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For innumerable evils have compassed me about;
VERSE:Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;
VERSE:They are more than the hairs of my head;
VERSE:And my heart hath failed me.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me:
VERSE:Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Let them be put to shame and confounded together
VERSE:That seek after my soul to destroy it:
VERSE:Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor
VERSE:That delight in my hurt.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let them be desolate by reason of their shame
VERSE:That say unto me, Aha, aha.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:
VERSE:Let such as love thy salvation say continually,
VERSE:Jehovah be magnified.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But I am poor and needy;
VERSE:Yet the Lord thinketh upon me:
VERSE:Thou art my help and my deliverer;
VERSE:Make no tarrying, O my God.
