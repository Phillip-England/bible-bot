CHAPTER:37
TITLE:Psalms 37
LABEL:1
VERSE:Fret not thyself because of evil-doers,
VERSE:Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,
VERSE:And wither as the green herb.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Trust in Jehovah, and do good;
VERSE:Dwell in the land, and feed on his faithfulness.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Delight thyself also in Jehovah;
VERSE:And he will give thee the desires of thy heart.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Commit thy way unto Jehovah;
VERSE:Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light,
VERSE:And thy justice as the noonday.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him:
VERSE:Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way,
VERSE:Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Cease from anger, and forsake wrath:
VERSE:Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For evil-doers shall be cut off;
VERSE:But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be:
VERSE:Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But the meek shall inherit the land,
VERSE:And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The wicked plotteth against the just,
VERSE:And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The Lord will laugh at him;
VERSE:For he seeth that his day is coming.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
VERSE:To cast down the poor and needy,
VERSE:To slay such as are upright in the way.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
VERSE:And their bows shall be broken.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Better is a little that the righteous hath
VERSE:Than the abundance of many wicked.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the arms of the wicked shall be broken;
VERSE:But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect;
VERSE:And their inheritance shall be for ever.
LABEL:19
VERSE:They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil;
VERSE:And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
LABEL:20
VERSE:But the wicked shall perish,
VERSE:And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs:
VERSE:They shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again;
VERSE:But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land;
VERSE:And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.
LABEL:23
VERSE:A manâ€™s goings are established of Jehovah;
VERSE:And he delighteth in his way.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down;
VERSE:For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I have been young, and now am old;
VERSE:Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
VERSE:Nor his seed begging bread.
LABEL:26
VERSE:All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth;
VERSE:And his seed is blessed.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Depart from evil, and do good;
VERSE:And dwell for evermore.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For Jehovah loveth justice,
VERSE:And forsaketh not his saints;
VERSE:They are preserved for ever:
VERSE:But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
LABEL:29
VERSE:The righteous shall inherit the land,
VERSE:And dwell therein for ever.
LABEL:30
VERSE:The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom,
VERSE:And his tongue speaketh justice.
LABEL:31
VERSE:The law of his God is in his heart;
VERSE:None of his steps shall slide.
LABEL:32
VERSE:The wicked watcheth the righteous,
VERSE:And seeketh to slay him.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Jehovah will not leave him in his hand,
VERSE:Nor condemn him when he is judged.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way,
VERSE:And he will exalt thee to inherit the land:
VERSE:When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
LABEL:35
VERSE:I have seen the wicked in great power,
VERSE:And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.
LABEL:36
VERSE:But one passed by, and, lo, he was not:
VERSE:Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
LABEL:37
VERSE:Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright;
VERSE:For there is a happy end to the man of peace.
LABEL:38
VERSE:As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together:
VERSE:The end of the wicked shall be cut off.
LABEL:39
VERSE:But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah:
VERSE:He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
LABEL:40
VERSE:And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them:
VERSE:He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them,
VERSE:Because they have taken refuge in him.
