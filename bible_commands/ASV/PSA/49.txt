CHAPTER:49
TITLE:Psalms 49
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear this, all ye peoples;
VERSE:Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Both low and high,
VERSE:Rich and poor together.
LABEL:3
VERSE:My mouth shall speak wisdom;
VERSE:And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will incline mine ear to a parable:
VERSE:I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
VERSE:When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?
LABEL:6
VERSE:They that trust in their wealth,
VERSE:And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
LABEL:7
VERSE:None of them can by any means redeem his brother,
VERSE:Nor give to God a ransom for him
LABEL:8
VERSE:(For the redemption of their life is costly,
VERSE:And it faileth for ever),
LABEL:9
VERSE:That he should still live alway,
VERSE:That he should not see corruption.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For he shall see it. Wise men die;
VERSE:The fool and the brutish alike perish,
VERSE:And leave their wealth to others.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,
VERSE:And their dwelling-places to all generations;
VERSE:They call their lands after their own names.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But man being in honor abideth not:
VERSE:He is like the beasts that perish.
LABEL:13
VERSE:This their way is their folly:
VERSE:Yet after them men approve their sayings. [Selah
LABEL:14
VERSE:They are appointed as a flock for Sheol;
VERSE:Death shall be their shepherd:
VERSE:And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
VERSE:And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume,
VERSE:That there be no habitation for it.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol;
VERSE:For he will receive me. [Selah
LABEL:16
VERSE:Be not thou afraid when one is made rich,
VERSE:When the glory of his house is increased:
LABEL:17
VERSE:For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away;
VERSE:His glory shall not descend after him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Though while he lived he blessed his soul
VERSE:(And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself),
LABEL:19
VERSE:He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
VERSE:They shall never see the light.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Man that is in honor, and understandeth not,
VERSE:Is like the beasts that perish.
