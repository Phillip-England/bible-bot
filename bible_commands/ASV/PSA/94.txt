TITLE:Psalms 94
LABEL:1
VERSE:O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth,
VERSE:Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
VERSE:Render to the proud their desert.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Jehovah, how long shall the wicked,
VERSE:How long shall the wicked triumph?
LABEL:4
VERSE:They prate, they speak arrogantly:
VERSE:All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah,
VERSE:And afflict thy heritage.
LABEL:6
VERSE:They slay the widow and the sojourner,
VERSE:And murder the fatherless.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And they say, Jehovah will not see,
VERSE:Neither will the God of Jacob consider.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Consider, ye brutish among the people;
VERSE:And ye fools, when will ye be wise?
LABEL:9
VERSE:He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
VERSE:He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
LABEL:10
VERSE:He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct,
VERSE:Even he that teacheth man knowledge?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man,
VERSE:That they are vanity.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah,
VERSE:And teachest out of thy law;
LABEL:13
VERSE:That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
VERSE:Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For Jehovah will not cast off his people,
VERSE:Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For judgment shall return unto righteousness;
VERSE:And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?
VERSE:Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
LABEL:17
VERSE:Unless Jehovah had been my help,
VERSE:My soul had soon dwelt in silence.
LABEL:18
VERSE:When I said, My foot slippeth;
VERSE:Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.
LABEL:19
VERSE:In the multitude of my thoughts within me
VERSE:Thy comforts delight my soul.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee,
VERSE:Which frameth mischief by statute?
LABEL:21
VERSE:They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
VERSE:And condemn the innocent blood.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But Jehovah hath been my high tower,
VERSE:And my God the rock of my refuge.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity,
VERSE:And will cut them off in their own wickedness;
VERSE:Jehovah our God will cut them off.
