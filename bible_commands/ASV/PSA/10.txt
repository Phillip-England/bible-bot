CHAPTER:10
TITLE:Psalms 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah?
VERSE:Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
LABEL:2
VERSE:In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued;
VERSE:Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the wicked boasteth of his heartâ€™s desire,
VERSE:And the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth Jehovah.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it.
VERSE:All his thoughts are, There is no God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:His ways are firm at all times;
VERSE:Thy judgments are far above out of his sight:
VERSE:As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved;
VERSE:To all generations I shall not be in adversity.
LABEL:7
VERSE:His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression:
VERSE:Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages;
VERSE:In the secret places doth he murder the innocent;
VERSE:His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert;
VERSE:He lieth in wait to catch the poor:
VERSE:He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He croucheth, he boweth down,
VERSE:And the helpless fall by his strong ones.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He saith in his heart: God hath forgotten;
VERSE:He hideth his face, he will never see it.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand:
VERSE:Forget not the poor.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God,
VERSE:And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand:
VERSE:The helpless committeth himself unto thee;
VERSE:Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Break thou the arm of the wicked;
VERSE:And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Jehovah is King for ever and ever:
VERSE:The nations are perished out of his land.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek:
VERSE:Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;
LABEL:18
VERSE:To judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
VERSE:That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.
