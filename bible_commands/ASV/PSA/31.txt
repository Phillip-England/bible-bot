CHAPTER:31
TITLE:Psalms 31
LABEL:1
VERSE:In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge;
VERSE:Let me never be put to shame:
VERSE:Deliver me in thy righteousness.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Bow down thine ear unto me; deliver me speedily:
VERSE:Be thou to me a strong rock,
VERSE:A house of defence to save me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For thou art my rock and my fortress;
VERSE:Therefore for thy nameâ€™s sake lead me and guide me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me;
VERSE:For thou art my stronghold.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Into thy hand I commend my spirit:
VERSE:Thou hast redeemed me, O Jehovah, thou God of truth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I hate them that regard lying vanities;
VERSE:But I trust in Jehovah.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I will be glad and rejoice in thy lovingkindness;
VERSE:For thou hast seen my affliction:
VERSE:Thou hast known my soul in adversities;
LABEL:8
VERSE:And thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy;
VERSE:Thou hast set my feet in a large place.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress:
VERSE:Mine eye wasteth away with grief, yea, my soul and my body.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For my life is spent with sorrow,
VERSE:And my years with sighing:
VERSE:My strength faileth because of mine iniquity,
VERSE:And my bones are wasted away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach,
VERSE:Yea, unto my neighbors exceedingly,
VERSE:And a fear to mine acquaintance:
VERSE:They that did see me without fled from me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
VERSE:I am like a broken vessel.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For I have heard the defaming of many,
VERSE:Terror on every side:
VERSE:While they took counsel together against me,
VERSE:They devised to take away my life.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah:
VERSE:I said, Thou art my God.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My times are in thy hand:
VERSE:Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:
VERSE:Save me in thy lovingkindness.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let me not be put to shame, O Jehovah; for I have called upon thee:
VERSE:Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Let the lying lips be dumb,
VERSE:Which speak against the righteous insolently,
VERSE:With pride and contempt.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Oh how great is thy goodness,
VERSE:Which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee,
VERSE:Which thou hast wrought for them that take refuge in thee,
VERSE:Before the sons of men!
LABEL:20
VERSE:In the covert of thy presence wilt thou hide them from the plottings of man:
VERSE:Thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Blessed be Jehovah;
VERSE:For he hath showed me his marvellous lovingkindness in a strong city.
LABEL:22
VERSE:As for me, I said in my haste,
VERSE:I am cut off from before thine eyes:
VERSE:Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications,
VERSE:When I cried unto thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Oh love Jehovah, all ye his saints:
VERSE:Jehovah preserveth the faithful,
VERSE:And plentifully rewardeth him that dealeth proudly.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
VERSE:All ye that hope in Jehovah.
