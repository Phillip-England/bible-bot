CHAPTER:109
TITLE:Psalms 109
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
LABEL:2
VERSE:For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me:
VERSE:They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They have compassed me about also with words of hatred,
VERSE:And fought against me without a cause.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For my love they are my adversaries:
VERSE:But I give myself unto prayer.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And they have rewarded me evil for good,
VERSE:And hatred for my love.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Set thou a wicked man over him;
VERSE:And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
LABEL:7
VERSE:When he is judged, let him come forth guilty;
VERSE:And let his prayer be turned into sin.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let his days be few;
VERSE:And let another take his office.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let his children be fatherless,
VERSE:And his wife a widow.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Let his children be vagabonds, and beg;
VERSE:And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
VERSE:And let strangers make spoil of his labor.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let there be none to extend kindness unto him;
VERSE:Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Let his posterity be cut off;
VERSE:In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah;
VERSE:And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let them be before Jehovah continually,
VERSE:That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
LABEL:16
VERSE:Because he remembered not to show kindness,
VERSE:But persecuted the poor and needy man,
VERSE:And the broken in heart, to slay them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him;
VERSE:And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment,
VERSE:And it came into his inward parts like water,
VERSE:And like oil into his bones.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself,
VERSE:And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
LABEL:20
VERSE:This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah,
VERSE:And of them that speak evil against my soul.
LABEL:21
VERSE:But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy nameâ€™s sake:
VERSE:Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;
LABEL:22
VERSE:For I am poor and needy,
VERSE:And my heart is wounded within me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
VERSE:I am tossed up and down as the locust.
LABEL:24
VERSE:My knees are weak through fasting;
VERSE:And my flesh faileth of fatness.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I am become also a reproach unto them:
VERSE:When they see me, they shake their head.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Help me, O Jehovah my God;
VERSE:Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:
LABEL:27
VERSE:That they may know that this is thy hand;
VERSE:That thou, Jehovah, hast done it.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Let them curse, but bless thou:
VERSE:When they arise, they shall be put to shame,
VERSE:But thy servant shall rejoice.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor,
VERSE:And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth;
VERSE:Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,
VERSE:To save him from them that judge his soul.
