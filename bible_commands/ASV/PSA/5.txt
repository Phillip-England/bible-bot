CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Psalms 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear to my words, O Jehovah,
VERSE:Consider my meditation.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God;
VERSE:For unto thee do I pray.
LABEL:3
VERSE:O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice;
VERSE:In the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
VERSE:Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight:
VERSE:Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies:
VERSE:Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house:
VERSE:In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
VERSE:Make thy way straight before my face.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
VERSE:Their inward part is very wickedness;
VERSE:Their throat is an open sepulchre;
VERSE:They flatter with their tongue.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Hold them guilty, O God;
VERSE:Let them fall by their own counsels;
VERSE:Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions;
VERSE:For they have rebelled against thee.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice,
VERSE:Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:
VERSE:Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For thou wilt bless the righteous;
VERSE:O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.
