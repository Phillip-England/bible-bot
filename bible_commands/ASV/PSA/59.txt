TITLE:Psalms 59
LABEL:1
VERSE:Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
VERSE:Set me on high from them that rise up against me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
VERSE:And save me from the bloodthirsty men.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul;
VERSE:The mighty gather themselves together against me:
VERSE:Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They run and prepare themselves without my fault:
VERSE:Awake thou to help me, and behold.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel,
VERSE:Arise to visit all the nations:
VERSE:Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. [Selah
LABEL:6
VERSE:They return at evening, they howl like a dog,
VERSE:And go round about the city.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
VERSE:Swords are in their lips:
VERSE:For who, say they, doth hear?
LABEL:8
VERSE:But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them;
VERSE:Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.
LABEL:9
VERSE:  Because of his strength I will give heed unto thee;
VERSE:For God is my high tower.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My God with his lovingkindness will meet me:
VERSE:God will let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Slay them not, lest my people forget:
VERSE:Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down,
VERSE:O Lord our shield.
LABEL:12
VERSE:  For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,
VERSE:Let them even be taken in their pride,
VERSE:And for cursing and lying which they speak.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more:
VERSE:And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob,
VERSE:Unto the ends of the earth. [Selah
LABEL:14
VERSE:And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog,
VERSE:And go round about the city.
LABEL:15
VERSE:They shall wander up and down for food,
VERSE:And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But I will sing of thy strength;
VERSE:Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning:
VERSE:For thou hast been my high tower,
VERSE:And a refuge in the day of my distress.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises:
VERSE:For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
