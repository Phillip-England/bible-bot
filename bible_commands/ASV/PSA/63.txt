VERSE:O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee:
VERSE:My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee,
VERSE:In a dry and weary land, where no water is.

VERSE:So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary,
VERSE:To see thy power and thy glory.

VERSE:Because thy lovingkindness is better than life,
VERSE:My lips shall praise thee.

VERSE:So will I bless thee while I live:
VERSE:I will lift up my hands in thy name.

VERSE:My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;
VERSE:And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips;

VERSE:When I remember thee upon my bed,
VERSE:And meditate on thee in the night-watches.

VERSE:For thou hast been my help,
VERSE:And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

VERSE:But the king shall rejoice in God:
VERSE:Every one that sweareth by him shall glory;
VERSE:For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
