CHAPTER:106
TITLE:Psalms 106
LABEL:1
VERSE:Praise ye Jehovah.
VERSE:Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good;
VERSE:For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah,
VERSE:Or show forth all his praise?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Blessed are they that keep justice,
VERSE:And he that doeth righteousness at all times.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people;
VERSE:Oh visit me with thy salvation,
LABEL:5
VERSE:That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen,
VERSE:That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,
VERSE:That I may glory with thine inheritance.
LABEL:6
VERSE:We have sinned with our fathers,
VERSE:We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt;
VERSE:They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses,
VERSE:But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Nevertheless he saved them for his nameâ€™s sake,
VERSE:That he might make his mighty power to be known.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up:
VERSE:So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
VERSE:And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
LABEL:11
VERSE:And the waters covered their adversaries;
VERSE:There was not one of them left.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Then believed they his words;
VERSE:They sang his praise.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They soon forgat his works;
VERSE:They waited not for his counsel,
LABEL:14
VERSE:But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
VERSE:And tempted God in the desert.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And he gave them their request,
VERSE:But sent leanness into their soul.
LABEL:16
VERSE:They envied Moses also in the camp,
VERSE:And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
VERSE:And covered the company of Abiram.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And a fire was kindled in their company;
VERSE:The flame burned up the wicked.
LABEL:19
VERSE:They made a calf in Horeb,
VERSE:And worshipped a molten image.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thus they changed their glory
VERSE:For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They forgat God their Saviour,
VERSE:Who had done great things in Egypt,
LABEL:22
VERSE:Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
VERSE:And terrible things by the Red Sea.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
VERSE:Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
VERSE:To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
VERSE:They believed not his word,
LABEL:25
VERSE:But murmured in their tents,
VERSE:And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Therefore he sware unto them,
VERSE:That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
LABEL:27
VERSE:And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,
VERSE:And scatter them in the lands.
LABEL:28
VERSE:They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,
VERSE:And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings;
VERSE:And the plague brake in upon them.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;
VERSE:And so the plague was stayed.
LABEL:31
VERSE:And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,
VERSE:Unto all generations for evermore.
LABEL:32
VERSE:They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,
VERSE:So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
LABEL:33
VERSE:Because they were rebellious against his spirit,
VERSE:And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
LABEL:34
VERSE:They did not destroy the peoples,
VERSE:As Jehovah commanded them,
LABEL:35
VERSE:But mingled themselves with the nations,
VERSE:And learned their works,
LABEL:36
VERSE:And served their idols,
VERSE:Which became a snare unto them.
LABEL:37
VERSE:Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
LABEL:38
VERSE:And shed innocent blood,
VERSE:Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
VERSE:Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;
VERSE:And the land was polluted with blood.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Thus were they defiled with their works,
VERSE:And played the harlot in their doings.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people,
VERSE:And he abhorred his inheritance.
LABEL:41
VERSE:And he gave them into the hand of the nations;
VERSE:And they that hated them ruled over them.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Their enemies also oppressed them,
VERSE:And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Many times did he deliver them;
VERSE:But they were rebellious in their counsel,
VERSE:And were brought low in their iniquity.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Nevertheless he regarded their distress,
VERSE:When he heard their cry:
LABEL:45
VERSE:And he remembered for them his covenant,
VERSE:And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
LABEL:46
VERSE:He made them also to be pitied
VERSE:Of all those that carried them captive.
LABEL:47
VERSE:Save us, O Jehovah our God,
VERSE:And gather us from among the nations,
VERSE:To give thanks unto thy holy name,
VERSE:And to triumph in thy praise.
LABEL:48
VERSE:Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
VERSE:From everlasting even to everlasting.
VERSE:And let all the people say, Amen.
VERSE:Praise ye Jehovah.
