CHAPTER:139
TITLE:Psalms 139
LABEL:1
VERSE:O Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising;
VERSE:Thou understandest my thought afar off.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thou searchest out my path and my lying down,
VERSE:And art acquainted with all my ways.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For there is not a word in my tongue,
VERSE:But, lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thou hast beset me behind and before,
VERSE:And laid thy hand upon me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
VERSE:It is high, I cannot attain unto it.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
VERSE:Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
LABEL:8
VERSE:If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
VERSE:If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.
LABEL:9
VERSE:If I take the wings of the morning,
VERSE:And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
LABEL:10
VERSE:Even there shall thy hand lead me,
VERSE:And thy right hand shall hold me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me,
VERSE:And the light about me shall be night;
LABEL:12
VERSE:Even the darkness hideth not from thee,
VERSE:But the night shineth as the day:
VERSE:The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For thou didst form my inward parts:
VERSE:Thou didst cover me in my motherâ€™s womb.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
VERSE:Wonderful are thy works;
VERSE:And that my soul knoweth right well.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My frame was not hidden from thee,
VERSE:When I was made in secret,
VERSE:And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance;
VERSE:And in thy book they were all written,
VERSE:Even the days that were ordained for me,
VERSE:When as yet there was none of them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!
VERSE:How great is the sum of them!
LABEL:18
VERSE:If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
VERSE:When I awake, I am still with thee.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God:
VERSE:Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.
LABEL:20
VERSE:For they speak against thee wickedly,
VERSE:And thine enemies take thy name in vain.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee?
VERSE:And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
LABEL:22
VERSE:I hate them with perfect hatred:
VERSE:They are become mine enemies.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Search me, O God, and know my heart:
VERSE:Try me, and know my thoughts;
LABEL:24
VERSE:And see if there be any wicked way in me,
VERSE:And lead me in the way everlasting.
