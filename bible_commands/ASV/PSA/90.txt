CHAPTER:90
TITLE:Psalms 90
LABEL:1
VERSE:Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
VERSE:In all generations.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Before the mountains were brought forth,
VERSE:Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
VERSE:Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thou turnest man to destruction,
VERSE:And sayest, Return, ye children of men.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For a thousand years in thy sight
VERSE:Are but as yesterday when it is past,
VERSE:And as a watch in the night.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
VERSE:In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
VERSE:In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For we are consumed in thine anger,
VERSE:And in thy wrath are we troubled.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
VERSE:Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
VERSE:We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The days of our years are threescore years and ten,
VERSE:Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;
VERSE:Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow;
VERSE:For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Who knoweth the power of thine anger,
VERSE:And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?
LABEL:12
VERSE:So teach us to number our days,
VERSE:That we may get us a heart of wisdom.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Return, O Jehovah; how long?
VERSE:And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness,
VERSE:That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
VERSE:And the years wherein we have seen evil.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
VERSE:And thy glory upon their children.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us;
VERSE:And establish thou the work of our hands upon us;
VERSE:Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
