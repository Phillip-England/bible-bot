CHAPTER:80
TITLE:Psalms 80
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
VERSE:Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
VERSE:Thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might,
VERSE:And come to save us.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Turn us again, O God;
VERSE:And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
LABEL:4
VERSE:O Jehovah God of hosts,
VERSE:How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears,
VERSE:And given them tears to drink in large measure.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors;
VERSE:And our enemies laugh among themselves.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Turn us again, O God of hosts;
VERSE:And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt:
VERSE:Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou preparedst room before it,
VERSE:And it took deep root, and filled the land.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The mountains were covered with the shadow of it,
VERSE:And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God.
LABEL:11
VERSE:It sent out its branches unto the sea,
VERSE:And its shoots unto the River.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why hast thou broken down its walls,
VERSE:So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
LABEL:13
VERSE:The boar out of the wood doth ravage it,
VERSE:And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts:
VERSE:Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
LABEL:15
VERSE:And the stock which thy right hand planted,
VERSE:And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
VERSE:They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
VERSE:Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
LABEL:18
VERSE:So shall we not go back from thee:
VERSE:Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts;
VERSE:Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
