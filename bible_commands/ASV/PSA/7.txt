CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Psalms 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge:
VERSE:Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Lest they tear my soul like a lion,
VERSE:Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
LABEL:3
VERSE:O Jehovah my God, if I have done this;
VERSE:If there be iniquity in my hands;
LABEL:4
VERSE:If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me
VERSE:(Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary);
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;
VERSE:Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth,
VERSE:And lay my glory in the dust. [Selah
LABEL:6
VERSE:Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger;
VERSE:Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries,
VERSE:And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about;
VERSE:And over them return thou on high.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples:
VERSE:Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous:
VERSE:For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My shield is with God,
VERSE:Who saveth the upright in heart.
LABEL:11
VERSE:God is a righteous judge,
VERSE:Yea, a God that hath indignation every day.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If a man turn not, he will whet his sword;
VERSE:He hath bent his bow, and made it ready;
LABEL:13
VERSE:He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;
VERSE:He maketh his arrows fiery shafts.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Behold, he travaileth with iniquity;
VERSE:Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He hath made a pit, and digged it,
VERSE:And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
LABEL:16
VERSE:His mischief shall return upon his own head,
VERSE:And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness,
VERSE:And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.
