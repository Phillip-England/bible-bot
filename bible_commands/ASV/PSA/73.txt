CHAPTER:73
TITLE:Psalms 73
LABEL:1
VERSE:Surely God is good to Israel,
VERSE:Even to such as are pure in heart.
LABEL:2
VERSE:But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
VERSE:My steps had well nigh slipped.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I was envious at the arrogant,
VERSE:When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For there are no pangs in their death;
VERSE:But their strength is firm.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They are not in trouble as other men;
VERSE:Neither are they plagued like other men.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck;
VERSE:Violence covereth them as a garment.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Their eyes stand out with fatness:
VERSE:They have more than heart could wish.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression:
VERSE:They speak loftily.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They have set their mouth in the heavens,
VERSE:And their tongue walketh through the earth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore his people return hither:
VERSE:And waters of a full cup are drained by them.
LABEL:11
VERSE:And they say, How doth God know?
VERSE:And is there knowledge in the Most High?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, these are the wicked;
VERSE:And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,
VERSE:And washed my hands in innocency;
LABEL:14
VERSE:For all the day long have I been plagued,
VERSE:And chastened every morning.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If I had said, I will speak thus;
VERSE:Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.
LABEL:16
VERSE:When I thought how I might know this,
VERSE:It was too painful for me;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Until I went into the sanctuary of God,
VERSE:And considered their latter end.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Surely thou settest them in slippery places:
VERSE:Thou castest them down to destruction.
LABEL:19
VERSE:How are they become a desolation in a moment!
VERSE:They are utterly consumed with terrors.
LABEL:20
VERSE:As a dream when one awaketh,
VERSE:So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For my soul was grieved,
VERSE:And I was pricked in my heart:
LABEL:22
VERSE:So brutish was I, and ignorant;
VERSE:I was as a beast before thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Nevertheless I am continually with thee:
VERSE:Thou hast holden my right hand.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel,
VERSE:And afterward receive me to glory.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Whom have I in heaven but thee?
VERSE:And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
LABEL:26
VERSE:My flesh and my heart faileth;
VERSE:But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
VERSE:Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee.
LABEL:28
VERSE:But it is good for me to draw near unto God:
VERSE:I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge,
VERSE:That I may tell of all thy works.
