TITLE:Psalms 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart;
VERSE:I will show forth all thy marvellous works.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I will be glad and exult in thee;
VERSE:I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.
LABEL:3
VERSE:When mine enemies turn back,
VERSE:They stumble and perish at thy presence.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou hast maintained my right and my cause;
VERSE:Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked;
VERSE:Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever;
VERSE:And the cities which thou hast overthrown,
VERSE:The very remembrance of them is perished.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But Jehovah sitteth as king for ever:
VERSE:He hath prepared his throne for judgment;
LABEL:8
VERSE:And he will judge the world in righteousness,
VERSE:He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed,
VERSE:A high tower in times of trouble;
LABEL:10
VERSE:And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee;
VERSE:For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion:
VERSE:Declare among the people his doings.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them;
VERSE:He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah;
VERSE:Behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me,
VERSE:Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;
LABEL:14
VERSE:That I may show forth all thy praise.
VERSE:In the gates of the daughter of Zion
VERSE:I will rejoice in thy salvation.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made:
VERSE:In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment:
VERSE:The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. [Higgaion. Selah
LABEL:17
VERSE:The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol,
VERSE:Even all the nations that forget God.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For the needy shall not alway be forgotten,
VERSE:Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail:
VERSE:Let the nations be judged in thy sight.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Put them in fear, O Jehovah:
VERSE:Let the nations know themselves to be but men. [Selah
