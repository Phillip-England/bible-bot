CHAPTER:74
TITLE:Psalms 74
LABEL:1
VERSE:O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever?
VERSE:Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old,
VERSE:Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance;
VERSE:And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins,
VERSE:All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly;
VERSE:They have set up their ensigns for signs.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They seemed as men that lifted up
VERSE:Axes upon a thicket of trees.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And now all the carved work thereof
VERSE:They break down with hatchet and hammers.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They have set thy sanctuary on fire;
VERSE:They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
VERSE:They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
LABEL:9
VERSE:We see not our signs:
VERSE:There is no more any prophet;
VERSE:Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
LABEL:10
VERSE:How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach?
VERSE:Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand?
VERSE:Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Yet God is my King of old,
VERSE:Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength:
VERSE:Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces;
VERSE:Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Thou didst cleave fountain and flood:
VERSE:Thou driedst up mighty rivers.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The day is thine, the night also is thine:
VERSE:Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
VERSE:Thou hast made summer and winter.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah,
VERSE:And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast:
VERSE:Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Have respect unto the covenant;
VERSE:For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed:
VERSE:Let the poor and needy praise thy name.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Arise, O God, plead thine own cause:
VERSE:Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Forget not the voice of thine adversaries:
VERSE:The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
