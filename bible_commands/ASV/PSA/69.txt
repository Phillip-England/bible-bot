CHAPTER:69
TITLE:Psalms 69
LABEL:1
VERSE:Save me, O God;
VERSE:For the waters are come in unto my soul.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing:
VERSE:I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried:
VERSE:Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head:
VERSE:They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
VERSE:That which I took not away I have to restore.
LABEL:5
VERSE:O God, thou knowest my foolishness;
VERSE:And my sins are not hid from thee.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts:
VERSE:Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;
VERSE:Shame hath covered my face.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I am become a stranger unto my brethren,
VERSE:And an alien unto my motherâ€™s children.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up;
VERSE:And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting,
VERSE:That was to my reproach.
LABEL:11
VERSE:When I made sackcloth my clothing,
VERSE:I became a byword unto them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They that sit in the gate talk of me;
VERSE:And I am the song of the drunkards.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time:
VERSE:O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness,
VERSE:Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink:
VERSE:Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,
VERSE:Neither let the deep swallow me up;
VERSE:And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good:
VERSE:According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And hide not thy face from thy servant;
VERSE:For I am in distress; answer me speedily.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it:
VERSE:Ransom me because of mine enemies.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor:
VERSE:Mine adversaries are all before thee.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness:
VERSE:And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
VERSE:And for comforters, but I found none.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They gave me also gall for my food;
VERSE:And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Let their table before them become a snare;
VERSE:And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see;
VERSE:And make their loins continually to shake.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Pour out thine indignation upon them,
VERSE:And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let their habitation be desolate;
VERSE:Let none dwell in their tents.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten;
VERSE:And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Add iniquity unto their iniquity;
VERSE:And let them not come into thy righteousness.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Let them be blotted out of the book of life,
VERSE:And not be written with the righteous.
LABEL:29
VERSE:But I am poor and sorrowful:
VERSE:Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I will praise the name of God with a song,
VERSE:And will magnify him with thanksgiving.
LABEL:31
VERSE:And it will please Jehovah better than an ox,
VERSE:Or a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
LABEL:32
VERSE:The meek have seen it, and are glad:
VERSE:Ye that seek after God, let your heart live.
LABEL:33
VERSE:For Jehovah heareth the needy,
VERSE:And despiseth not his prisoners.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Let heaven and earth praise him,
VERSE:The seas, and everything that moveth therein.
LABEL:35
VERSE:For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah;
VERSE:And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.
LABEL:36
VERSE:The seed also of his servants shall inherit it;
VERSE:And they that love his name shall dwell therein.
