CHAPTER:39
TITLE:Psalms 39
LABEL:1
VERSE:I said, I will take heed to my ways,
VERSE:That I sin not with my tongue:
VERSE:I will keep my mouth with a bridle,
VERSE:While the wicked is before me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good;
VERSE:And my sorrow was stirred.
LABEL:3
VERSE:My heart was hot within me;
VERSE:While I was musing the fire burned;
VERSE:Then spake I with my tongue:
LABEL:4
VERSE:Jehovah, make me to know mine end,
VERSE:And the measure of my days, what it is;
VERSE:Let me know how frail I am.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths;
VERSE:And my life-time is as nothing before thee:
VERSE:Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. [Selah
LABEL:6
VERSE:Surely every man walketh in a vain show;
VERSE:Surely they are disquieted in vain:
VERSE:He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And now, Lord, what wait I for?
VERSE:My hope is in thee.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Deliver me from all my transgressions:
VERSE:Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
VERSE:Because thou didst it.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Remove thy stroke away from me:
VERSE:I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.
LABEL:11
VERSE:When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity,
VERSE:Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth:
VERSE:Surely every man is vanity. [Selah
LABEL:12
VERSE:Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry;
VERSE:Hold not thy peace at my tears:
VERSE:For I am a stranger with thee,
VERSE:A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,
VERSE:Before I go hence, and be no more.
