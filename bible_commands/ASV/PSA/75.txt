VERSE:And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
LABEL:5
VERSE:Lift not up your horn on high;
VERSE:Speak not with a stiff neck.

VERSE:For neither from the east, nor from the west,
VERSE:Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up.

VERSE:But God is the judge:
VERSE:He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.

VERSE:For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth;

VERSE:But I will declare for ever,
VERSE:I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
