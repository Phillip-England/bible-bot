CHAPTER:71
TITLE:Psalms 71
LABEL:1
VERSE:In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge:
VERSE:Let me never be put to shame.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me:
VERSE:Bow down thine ear unto me, and save me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
VERSE:Thou hast given commandment to save me;
VERSE:For thou art my rock and my fortress.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
VERSE:Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah:
VERSE:Thou art my trust from my youth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:By thee have I been holden up from the womb;
VERSE:Thou art he that took me out of my motherâ€™s bowels:
VERSE:My praise shall be continually of thee.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I am as a wonder unto many;
VERSE:But thou art my strong refuge.
LABEL:8
VERSE:My mouth shall be filled with thy praise,
VERSE:And with thy honor all the day.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Cast me not off in the time of old age;
VERSE:Forsake me not when my strength faileth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For mine enemies speak concerning me;
VERSE:And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,
LABEL:11
VERSE:Saying, God hath forsaken him:
VERSE:Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.
LABEL:12
VERSE:O God, be not far from me;
VERSE:O my God, make haste to help me.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Let them be put to shame and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
VERSE:Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But I will hope continually,
VERSE:And will praise thee yet more and more.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness,
VERSE:And of thy salvation all the day;
VERSE:For I know not the numbers thereof.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Jehovah:
VERSE:I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
LABEL:17
VERSE:O God, thou hast taught me from my youth;
VERSE:And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not,
VERSE:Until I have declared thy strength unto the next generation,
VERSE:Thy might to every one that is to come.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high;
VERSE:Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto thee?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou, who hast showed us many and sore troubles,
VERSE:Wilt quicken us again,
VERSE:And wilt bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Increase thou my greatness,
VERSE:And turn again and comfort me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:I will also praise thee with the psaltery,
VERSE:Even thy truth, O my God:
VERSE:Unto thee will I sing praises with the harp,
VERSE:O thou Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:23
VERSE:My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises unto thee;
VERSE:And my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
LABEL:24
VERSE:My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long;
VERSE:For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.
