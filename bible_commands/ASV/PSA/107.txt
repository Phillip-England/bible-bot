CHAPTER:107
TITLE:Psalms 107
LABEL:1
VERSE:O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good;
VERSE:For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so,
VERSE:Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
LABEL:3
VERSE:And gathered out of the lands,
VERSE:From the east and from the west,
VERSE:From the north and from the south.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;
VERSE:They found no city of habitation.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Hungry and thirsty,
VERSE:Their soul fainted in them.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,
VERSE:And he delivered them out of their distresses,
LABEL:7
VERSE:He led them also by a straight way,
VERSE:That they might go to a city of habitation.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness,
VERSE:And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
LABEL:9
VERSE:For he satisfieth the longing soul,
VERSE:And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
VERSE:Being bound in affliction and iron,
LABEL:11
VERSE:Because they rebelled against the words of God,
VERSE:And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore he brought down their heart with labor;
VERSE:They fell down, and there was none to help.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,
VERSE:And he saved them out of their distresses.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
VERSE:And brake their bonds in sunder.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness,
VERSE:And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
LABEL:16
VERSE:For he hath broken the gates of brass,
VERSE:And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Fools because of their transgression,
VERSE:And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Their soul abhorreth all manner of food;
VERSE:And they draw near unto the gates of death.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
VERSE:And he saveth them out of their distresses.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He sendeth his word, and healeth them,
VERSE:And delivereth them from their destructions.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness,
VERSE:And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
LABEL:22
VERSE:And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
VERSE:And declare his works with singing.
LABEL:23
VERSE:They that go down to the sea in ships,
VERSE:That do business in great waters;
LABEL:24
VERSE:These see the works of Jehovah,
VERSE:And his wonders in the deep.
LABEL:25
VERSE:For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
VERSE:Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths:
VERSE:Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
LABEL:27
VERSE:They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
VERSE:And are at their witsâ€™ end.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
VERSE:And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
LABEL:29
VERSE:He maketh the storm a calm,
VERSE:So that the waves thereof are still.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Then are they glad because they are quiet;
VERSE:So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness,
VERSE:And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
LABEL:32
VERSE:Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
VERSE:And praise him in the seat of the elders.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
VERSE:And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
LABEL:34
VERSE:A fruitful land into a salt desert,
VERSE:For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
LABEL:35
VERSE:He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
VERSE:And a dry land into watersprings.
LABEL:36
VERSE:And there he maketh the hungry to dwell,
VERSE:That they may prepare a city of habitation,
LABEL:37
VERSE:And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
VERSE:And get them fruits of increase.
LABEL:38
VERSE:He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
VERSE:And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Again, they are diminished and bowed down
VERSE:Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
LABEL:40
VERSE:He poureth contempt upon princes,
VERSE:And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction,
VERSE:And maketh him families like a flock.
LABEL:42
VERSE:The upright shall see it, and be glad;
VERSE:And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Whoso is wise will give heed to these things;
VERSE:And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.
