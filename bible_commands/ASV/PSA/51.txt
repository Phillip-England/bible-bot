CHAPTER:51
TITLE:Psalms 51
LABEL:1
VERSE:Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
VERSE:According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
VERSE:And cleanse me from my sin.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I know my transgressions;
VERSE:And my sin is ever before me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
VERSE:And done that which is evil in thy sight;
VERSE:That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest,
VERSE:And be clear when thou judgest.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity;
VERSE:And in sin did my mother conceive me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts;
VERSE:And in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:
VERSE:Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Make me to hear joy and gladness,
VERSE:That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Hide thy face from my sins,
VERSE:And blot out all mine iniquities.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Create in me a clean heart, O God;
VERSE:And renew a right spirit within me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Cast me not away from thy presence;
VERSE:And take not thy holy Spirit from me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
VERSE:And uphold me with a willing spirit.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Then will I teach transgressors thy ways;
VERSE:And sinners shall be converted unto thee.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation;
VERSE:And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
LABEL:15
VERSE:O Lord, open thou my lips;
VERSE:And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it:
VERSE:Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:
VERSE:A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
VERSE:Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Then wilt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
VERSE:In burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering:
VERSE:Then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
