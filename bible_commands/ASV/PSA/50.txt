CHAPTER:50
TITLE:Psalms 50
LABEL:1
VERSE:The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken,
VERSE:And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
VERSE:God hath shined forth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence:
VERSE:A fire devoureth before him,
VERSE:And it is very tempestuous round about him.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He calleth to the heavens above,
VERSE:And to the earth, that he may judge his people:
LABEL:5
VERSE:Gather my saints together unto me,
VERSE:Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And the heavens shall declare his righteousness;
VERSE:For God is judge himself. [Selah
LABEL:7
VERSE:Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
VERSE:O Israel, and I will testify unto thee:
VERSE:I am God, even thy God.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices;
VERSE:And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I will take no bullock out of thy house,
VERSE:Nor he-goats out of thy folds.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For every beast of the forest is mine,
VERSE:And the cattle upon a thousand hills.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I know all the birds of the mountains;
VERSE:And the wild beasts of the field are mine.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If I were hungry, I would not tell thee;
VERSE:For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Will I eat the flesh of bulls,
VERSE:Or drink the blood of goats?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving;
VERSE:And pay thy vows unto the Most High;
LABEL:15
VERSE:And call upon me in the day of trouble:
VERSE:I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But unto the wicked God saith,
VERSE:What hast thou to do to declare my statutes,
VERSE:And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Seeing that thou hatest instruction,
VERSE:And castest my words behind thee?
LABEL:18
VERSE:When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him,
VERSE:And hast been partaker with adulterers.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thou givest thy mouth to evil,
VERSE:And thy tongue frameth deceit.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother;
VERSE:Thou slanderest thine own motherâ€™s son.
LABEL:21
VERSE:These things hast thou done, and I kept silence;
VERSE:Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself:
VERSE:But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Now consider this, ye that forget God,
VERSE:Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:
LABEL:23
VERSE:Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me;
VERSE:And to him that ordereth his way aright
VERSE:Will I show the salvation of God.
