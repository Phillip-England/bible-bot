CHAPTER:27
TITLE:Psalms 27
LABEL:1
VERSE:Jehovah is my light and my salvation;
VERSE:Whom shall I fear?
VERSE:Jehovah is the strength of my life;
VERSE:Of whom shall I be afraid?
LABEL:2
VERSE:When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh,
VERSE:Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Though a host should encamp against me,
VERSE:My heart shall not fear:
VERSE:Though war should rise against me,
VERSE:Even then will I be confident.
LABEL:4
VERSE:One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after:
VERSE:That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life,
VERSE:To behold the beauty of Jehovah,
VERSE:And to inquire in his temple.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion:
VERSE:In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me;
VERSE:He will lift me up upon a rock.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me;
VERSE:And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
VERSE:I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice:
VERSE:Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:  When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
VERSE:Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Hide not thy face from me;
VERSE:Put not thy servant away in anger:
VERSE:Thou hast been my help;
VERSE:Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
LABEL:10
VERSE:When my father and my mother forsake me,
VERSE:Then Jehovah will take me up.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Teach me thy way, O Jehovah;
VERSE:And lead me in a plain path,
VERSE:Because of mine enemies.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries:
VERSE:For false witnesses are risen up against me,
VERSE:And such as breathe out cruelty.
LABEL:13
VERSE:  I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah
VERSE:In the land of the living.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Wait for Jehovah:
VERSE:Be strong, and let thy heart take courage;
VERSE:Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.
