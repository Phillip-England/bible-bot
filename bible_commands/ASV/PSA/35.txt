CHAPTER:35
TITLE:Psalms 35
LABEL:1
VERSE:Strive thou, O Jehovah, with them that strive with me:
VERSE:Fight thou against them that fight against me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Take hold of shield and buckler,
VERSE:And stand up for my help.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me:
VERSE:Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let them be put to shame and brought to dishonor that seek after my soul:
VERSE:Let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let them be as chaff before the wind,
VERSE:And the angel of Jehovah driving them on.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Let their way be dark and slippery,
VERSE:And the angel of Jehovah pursuing them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit;
VERSE:Without cause have they digged a pit for my soul.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let destruction come upon him unawares;
VERSE:And let his net that he hath hid catch himself:
VERSE:With destruction let him fall therein.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah:
VERSE:It shall rejoice in his salvation.
LABEL:10
VERSE:All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is like unto thee,
VERSE:Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
VERSE:Yea, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Unrighteous witnesses rise up;
VERSE:They ask me of things that I know not.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They reward me evil for good,
VERSE:To the bereaving of my soul.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
VERSE:I afflicted my soul with fasting;
VERSE:And my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother:
VERSE:I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth his mother.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together:
VERSE:The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not;
VERSE:They did tear me, and ceased not:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Like the profane mockers in feasts,
VERSE:They gnashed upon me with their teeth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
VERSE:Rescue my soul from their destructions,
VERSE:My darling from the lions.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I will give thee thanks in the great assembly:
VERSE:I will praise thee among much people.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;
VERSE:Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
LABEL:20
VERSE:For they speak not peace;
VERSE:But they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me;
VERSE:They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Thou hast seen it, O Jehovah; keep not silence:
VERSE:O Lord, be not far from me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Stir up thyself, and awake to the justice due unto me,
VERSE:Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Judge me, O Jehovah my God, according to thy righteousness;
VERSE:And let them not rejoice over me.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it:
VERSE:Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Let them be put to shame and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt:
VERSE:Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause:
VERSE:Yea, let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified,
VERSE:Who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
LABEL:28
VERSE:And my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness
VERSE:And of thy praise all the day long.
