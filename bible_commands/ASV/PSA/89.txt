CHAPTER:89
TITLE:Psalms 89
LABEL:1
VERSE:I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever:
VERSE:With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever;
VERSE:Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have made a covenant with my chosen,
VERSE:I have sworn unto David my servant:
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy seed will I establish for ever,
VERSE:And build up thy throne to all generations. [Selah
LABEL:5
VERSE:And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah;
VERSE:Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah?
VERSE:Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah,
LABEL:7
VERSE:A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones,
VERSE:And to be feared above all them that are round about him?
LABEL:8
VERSE:O Jehovah God of hosts,
VERSE:Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah?
VERSE:And thy faithfulness is round about thee.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou rulest the pride of the sea:
VERSE:When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
VERSE:Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
VERSE:The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The north and the south, thou hast created them:
VERSE:Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou hast a mighty arm;
VERSE:Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne:
VERSE:Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:
VERSE:They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.
LABEL:16
VERSE:In thy name do they rejoice all the day;
VERSE:And in thy righteousness are they exalted.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For thou art the glory of their strength;
VERSE:And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah;
VERSE:And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints,
VERSE:And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty;
VERSE:I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I have found David my servant;
VERSE:With my holy oil have I anointed him:
LABEL:21
VERSE:With whom my hand shall be established;
VERSE:Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The enemy shall not exact from him,
VERSE:Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And I will beat down his adversaries before him,
VERSE:And smite them that hate him.
LABEL:24
VERSE:But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him;
VERSE:And in my name shall his horn be exalted.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I will set his hand also on the sea,
VERSE:And his right hand on the rivers.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father,
VERSE:My God, and the rock of my salvation.
LABEL:27
VERSE:I also will make him my first-born,
VERSE:The highest of the kings of the earth.
LABEL:28
VERSE:My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore;
VERSE:And my covenant shall stand fast with him.
LABEL:29
VERSE:His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
VERSE:And his throne as the days of heaven.
LABEL:30
VERSE:If his children forsake my law,
VERSE:And walk not in mine ordinances;
LABEL:31
VERSE:If they break my statutes,
VERSE:And keep not my commandments;
LABEL:32
VERSE:Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,
VERSE:And their iniquity with stripes.
LABEL:33
VERSE:But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
VERSE:Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
LABEL:34
VERSE:My covenant will I not break,
VERSE:Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Once have I sworn by my holiness:
VERSE:I will not lie unto David:
LABEL:36
VERSE:His seed shall endure for ever,
VERSE:And his throne as the sun before me.
LABEL:37
VERSE:It shall be established for ever as the moon,
VERSE:And as the faithful witness in the sky. [Selah
LABEL:38
VERSE:But thou hast cast off and rejected,
VERSE:Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant:
VERSE:Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
VERSE:Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
LABEL:41
VERSE:All that pass by the way rob him:
VERSE:He is become a reproach to his neighbors.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries;
VERSE:Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword,
VERSE:And hast not made him to stand in the battle.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Thou hast made his brightness to cease,
VERSE:And cast his throne down to the ground.
LABEL:45
VERSE:The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
VERSE:Thou hast covered him with shame. [Selah
LABEL:46
VERSE:How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
VERSE:How long shall thy wrath burn like fire?
LABEL:47
VERSE:Oh remember how short my time is:
VERSE:For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!
LABEL:48
VERSE:What man is he that shall live and not see death,
VERSE:That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? [Selah
LABEL:49
VERSE:Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses,
VERSE:Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness?
LABEL:50
VERSE:Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants;
VERSE:How I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples,
LABEL:51
VERSE:Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah,
VERSE:Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
LABEL:52
VERSE:Blessed be Jehovah for evermore.
VERSE:Amen, and Amen.
