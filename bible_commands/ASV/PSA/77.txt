VERSE:I will cry unto God with my voice,
VERSE:Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.

VERSE:In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord:
VERSE:My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not;
VERSE:My soul refused to be comforted.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I remember God, and am disquieted:
VERSE:I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. [Selah

VERSE:Thou holdest mine eyes watching:
VERSE:I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I have considered the days of old,
VERSE:The years of ancient times.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I call to remembrance my song in the night:
VERSE:I commune with mine own heart;
VERSE:And my spirit maketh diligent search.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Will the Lord cast off for ever?
VERSE:And will he be favorable no more?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever?
VERSE:Doth his promise fail for evermore?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
VERSE:Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? [Selah

VERSE:And I said, This is my infirmity;
VERSE:But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah;
VERSE:For I will remember thy wonders of old.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will meditate also upon all thy work,
VERSE:And muse on thy doings.

VERSE:Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
VERSE:Who is a great god like unto God?

VERSE:Thou art the God that doest wonders:
VERSE:Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people,
VERSE:The sons of Jacob and Joseph. [Selah

VERSE:The waters saw thee, O God;
VERSE:The waters saw thee, they were afraid:
VERSE:The depths also trembled.

VERSE:The clouds poured out water;
VERSE:The skies sent out a sound:
VERSE:Thine arrows also went abroad.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind;
VERSE:The lightnings lightened the world:
VERSE:The earth trembled and shook.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thy way was in the sea,
VERSE:And thy paths in the great waters,
VERSE:And thy footsteps were not known.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou leddest thy people like a flock,
VERSE:By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
