VERSE:My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter;
VERSE:I speak the things which I have made touching the king:

VERSE:Thou art fairer than the children of men;
VERSE:Grace is poured into thy lips:
VERSE:Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

VERSE:Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one,
VERSE:Thy glory and thy majesty.

VERSE:Because of truth and meekness and righteousness:
VERSE:And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thine arrows are sharp;
VERSE:The peoples fall under thee;

LABEL:6
VERSE:Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
VERSE:A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

VERSE:Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee
VERSE:With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

VERSE:Kings’ daughters are among thy honorable women:
VERSE:At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;

VERSE:So will the king desire thy beauty;
VERSE:For he is thy lord; and reverence thou him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift;

VERSE:Shall be brought unto thee.

VERSE:Whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.
