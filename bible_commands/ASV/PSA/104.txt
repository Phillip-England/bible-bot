TITLE:Psalms 104
LABEL:1
VERSE:Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
VERSE:O Jehovah my God, thou art very great;
VERSE:Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
LABEL:2
VERSE:Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment;
VERSE:Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
LABEL:3
VERSE:Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters;
VERSE:Who maketh the clouds his chariot;
VERSE:Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who maketh winds his messengers;
VERSE:Flames of fire his ministers;
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who laid the foundations of the earth,
VERSE:That it should not be moved for ever.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;
VERSE:The waters stood above the mountains.
LABEL:7
VERSE:At thy rebuke they fled;
VERSE:At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
LABEL:8
VERSE:(The mountains rose, the valleys sank down)
VERSE:Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
VERSE:That they turn not again to cover the earth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He sendeth forth springs into the valleys;
VERSE:They run among the mountains;
LABEL:11
VERSE:They give drink to every beast of the field;
VERSE:The wild asses quench their thirst.
LABEL:12
VERSE:By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation;
VERSE:They sing among the branches.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He watereth the mountains from his chambers:
VERSE:The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
VERSE:And herb for the service of man;
VERSE:That he may bring forth food out of the earth,
LABEL:15
VERSE:And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
VERSE:And oil to make his face to shine,
VERSE:And bread that strengtheneth manâ€™s heart.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture,
VERSE:The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Where the birds make their nests:
VERSE:As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The high mountains are for the wild goats;
VERSE:The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He appointed the moon for seasons:
VERSE:The sun knoweth his going down.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou makest darkness, and it is night,
VERSE:Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The young lions roar after their prey,
VERSE:And seek their food from God.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The sun ariseth, they get them away,
VERSE:And lay them down in their dens.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Man goeth forth unto his work
VERSE:And to his labor until the evening.
LABEL:24
VERSE:O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works!
VERSE:In wisdom hast thou made them all:
VERSE:The earth is full of thy riches.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
VERSE:Wherein are things creeping innumerable,
VERSE:Both small and great beasts.
LABEL:26
VERSE:There go the ships;
VERSE:There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.
LABEL:27
VERSE:These wait all for thee,
VERSE:That thou mayest give them their food in due season.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Thou givest unto them, they gather;
VERSE:Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled;
VERSE:Thou takest away their breath, they die,
VERSE:And return to their dust.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created;
VERSE:And thou renewest the face of the ground.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever;
VERSE:Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:
LABEL:32
VERSE:Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;
VERSE:He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
LABEL:33
VERSE:I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live:
VERSE:I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Let my meditation be sweet unto him:
VERSE:I will rejoice in Jehovah.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.
VERSE:And let the wicked be no more.
VERSE:Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
VERSE:Praise ye Jehovah.
