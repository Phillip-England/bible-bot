VERSE:Blessed be Jehovah my rock,
VERSE:Who teacheth my hands to war,
VERSE:And my fingers to fight:

VERSE:My lovingkindness, and my fortress,
VERSE:My high tower, and my deliverer;
VERSE:My shield, and he in whom I take refuge;
VERSE:Who subdueth my people under me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him?
VERSE:Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?

VERSE:His days are as a shadow that passeth away.

VERSE:Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down:
VERSE:Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

VERSE:Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;
VERSE:Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Stretch forth thy hand from above;
VERSE:Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,
VERSE:Out of the hand of aliens;
LABEL:8
VERSE:Whose mouth speaketh deceit,
VERSE:And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

VERSE:Whose mouth speaketh deceit,
VERSE:And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth,
VERSE:And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;
LABEL:13
VERSE:  When our garners are full, affording all manner of store,
VERSE:And our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
LABEL:14
VERSE:  When our oxen are well laden;
VERSE:When there is no breaking in, and no going forth,
VERSE:And no outcry in our streets:
LABEL:15
VERSE:Happy is the people that is in such a case;
VERSE:Yea, happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.
