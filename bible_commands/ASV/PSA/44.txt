CHAPTER:44
TITLE:Psalms 44
LABEL:1
VERSE:We have heard with our ears, O God,
VERSE:Our fathers have told us,
VERSE:What work thou didst in their days,
VERSE:In the days of old.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand;
VERSE:But them thou didst plant:
VERSE:Thou didst afflict the peoples;
VERSE:But them thou didst spread abroad.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword,
VERSE:Neither did their own arm save them;
VERSE:But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
VERSE:Because thou wast favorable unto them.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thou art my King, O God:
VERSE:Command deliverance for Jacob.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Through thee will we push down our adversaries:
VERSE:Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For I will not trust in my bow,
VERSE:Neither shall my sword save me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But thou hast saved us from our adversaries,
VERSE:And hast put them to shame that hate us.
LABEL:8
VERSE:In God have we made our boast all the day long,
VERSE:And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. [Selah
LABEL:9
VERSE:But now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonor,
VERSE:And goest not forth with our hosts.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary;
VERSE:And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Thou hast made us like sheep appointed for food,
VERSE:And hast scattered us among the nations.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Thou sellest thy people for nought,
VERSE:And hast not increased thy wealth by their price.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors,
VERSE:A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thou makest us a byword among the nations,
VERSE:A shaking of the head among the peoples.
LABEL:15
VERSE:All the day long is my dishonor before me,
VERSE:And the shame of my face hath covered me,
LABEL:16
VERSE:For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth,
VERSE:By reason of the enemy and the avenger.
LABEL:17
VERSE:All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
VERSE:Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Our heart is not turned back,
VERSE:Neither have our steps declined from thy way,
LABEL:19
VERSE:That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals,
VERSE:And covered us with the shadow of death.
LABEL:20
VERSE:If we have forgotten the name of our God,
VERSE:Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
LABEL:21
VERSE:Will not God search this out?
VERSE:For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long;
VERSE:We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
VERSE:Arise, cast us not off for ever.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
VERSE:And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
LABEL:25
VERSE:For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
VERSE:Our body cleaveth unto the earth.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Rise up for our help,
VERSE:And redeem us for thy lovingkindnessâ€™ sake.
