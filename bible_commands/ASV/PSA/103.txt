VERSE:Bless Jehovah, O my soul,
VERSE:And forget not all his benefits:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
VERSE:Who healeth all thy diseases;
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
VERSE:Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who satisfieth thy desire with good things,
VERSE:So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.

VERSE:Jehovah executeth righteous acts,
VERSE:And judgments for all that are oppressed.

VERSE:He made known his ways unto Moses,
VERSE:His doings unto the children of Israel.

VERSE:Jehovah is merciful and gracious,
VERSE:Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.

VERSE:He will not always chide;
VERSE:Neither will he keep his anger for ever.

VERSE:He hath not dealt with us after our sins,
VERSE:Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.

VERSE:So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.

VERSE:As far as the east is from the west,
VERSE:So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Like as a father pitieth his children,
VERSE:So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.

VERSE:For he knoweth our frame;
VERSE:He remembereth that we are dust.

VERSE:As for man, his days are as grass;
VERSE:As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
VERSE:And the place thereof shall know it no more.

VERSE:Hearkening unto the voice of his word.

VERSE:Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts,
VERSE:Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

VERSE:Bless Jehovah, all ye his works,
VERSE:In all places of his dominion:
VERSE:Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
