CHAPTER:8
TITLE:1 Corinthians 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;
LABEL:3
VERSE:but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;
LABEL:6
VERSE:yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
LABEL:9
VERSE:But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idolâ€™s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
LABEL:11
VERSE:For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
LABEL:12
VERSE:And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.
