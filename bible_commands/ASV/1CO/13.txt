CHAPTER:13
TITLE:1 Corinthians 13
LABEL:1
VERSE:If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
LABEL:5
VERSE:doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;
LABEL:6
VERSE:rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;
LABEL:7
VERSE:beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
LABEL:10
VERSE:but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
