BOOK:2TI
CHAPTER:4
TITLE:2 Timothy 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
LABEL:2
VERSE:preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;
LABEL:4
VERSE:and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:
LABEL:8
VERSE:henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Give diligence to come shortly unto me:
LABEL:10
VERSE:for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:
LABEL:15
VERSE:of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.
LABEL:16
VERSE:At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
