CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Titus 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
LABEL:2
VERSE:to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
LABEL:5
VERSE:not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
LABEL:6
VERSE:which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
LABEL:7
VERSE:that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
LABEL:9
VERSE:but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
LABEL:10
VERSE:A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
LABEL:11
VERSE:knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
LABEL:15
VERSE:All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith.
VERSE:Grace be with you all.
