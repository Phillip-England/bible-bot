CHAPTER:2
TITLE:1 Timothy 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;
LABEL:2
VERSE:for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.
LABEL:3
VERSE:This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
LABEL:4
VERSE:who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus,
LABEL:6
VERSE:who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times;
LABEL:7
VERSE:whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;
LABEL:10
VERSE:but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
LABEL:14
VERSE:and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:
LABEL:15
VERSE:but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
