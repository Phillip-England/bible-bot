CHAPTER:32
TITLE:Deuteronomy 32
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak;
VERSE:And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:My doctrine shall drop as the rain;
VERSE:My speech shall distil as the dew,
VERSE:As the small rain upon the tender grass,
VERSE:And as the showers upon the herb.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah:
VERSE:Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The Rock, his work is perfect;
VERSE:For all his ways are justice:
VERSE:A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,
VERSE:Just and right is he.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish;
VERSE:They are a perverse and crooked generation.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Do ye thus requite Jehovah,
VERSE:O foolish people and unwise?
VERSE:Is not he thy father that hath bought thee?
VERSE:He hath made thee, and established thee.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Remember the days of old,
VERSE:Consider the years of many generations:
VERSE:Ask thy father, and he will show thee;
VERSE:Thine elders, and they will tell thee.
LABEL:8
VERSE:When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
VERSE:When he separated the children of men,
VERSE:He set the bounds of the peoples
VERSE:According to the number of the children of Israel.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For Jehovahâ€™s portion is his people;
VERSE:Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He found him in a desert land,
VERSE:And in the waste howling wilderness;
VERSE:He compassed him about, he cared for him,
VERSE:He kept him as the apple of his eye.
LABEL:11
VERSE:As an eagle that stirreth up her nest,
VERSE:That fluttereth over her young,
VERSE:He spread abroad his wings, he took them,
VERSE:He bare them on his pinions.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Jehovah alone did lead him,
VERSE:And there was no foreign god with him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
VERSE:And he did eat the increase of the field;
VERSE:And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,
VERSE:And oil out of the flinty rock;
LABEL:14
VERSE:Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock,
VERSE:With fat of lambs,
VERSE:And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
VERSE:With the finest of the wheat;
VERSE:And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:
VERSE:Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek;
VERSE:Then he forsook God who made him,
VERSE:And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:They moved him to jealousy with strange gods;
VERSE:With abominations provoked they him to anger.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They sacrificed unto demons, which were no God,
VERSE:To gods that they knew not,
VERSE:To new gods that came up of late,
VERSE:Which your fathers dreaded not.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,
VERSE:And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth.
LABEL:19
VERSE:And Jehovah saw it, and abhorred them,
VERSE:Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
LABEL:20
VERSE:And he said, I will hide my face from them,
VERSE:I will see what their end shall be:
VERSE:For they are a very perverse generation,
VERSE:Children in whom is no faithfulness.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
VERSE:They have provoked me to anger with their vanities:
VERSE:And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people;
VERSE:I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
VERSE:And burneth unto the lowest Sheol,
VERSE:And devoureth the earth with its increase,
VERSE:And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I will heap evils upon them;
VERSE:I will spend mine arrows upon them:
LABEL:24
VERSE:  They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat
VERSE:And bitter destruction;
VERSE:And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,
VERSE:With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Without shall the sword bereave,
VERSE:And in the chambers terror;
VERSE:It shall destroy both young man and virgin,
VERSE:The suckling with the man of gray hairs.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I said, I would scatter them afar,
VERSE:I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
LABEL:27
VERSE:Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
VERSE:Lest their adversaries should judge amiss,
VERSE:Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted,
VERSE:And Jehovah hath not done all this.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For they are a nation void of counsel,
VERSE:And there is no understanding in them.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,
VERSE:That they would consider their latter end!
LABEL:30
VERSE:How should one chase a thousand,
VERSE:And two put ten thousand to flight,
VERSE:Except their Rock had sold them,
VERSE:And Jehovah had delivered them up?
LABEL:31
VERSE:For their rock is not as our Rock,
VERSE:Even our enemies themselves being judges.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
VERSE:And of the fields of Gomorrah:
VERSE:Their grapes are grapes of gall,
VERSE:Their clusters are bitter:
LABEL:33
VERSE:Their wine is the poison of serpents,
VERSE:And the cruel venom of asps.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Is not this laid up in store with me,
VERSE:Sealed up among my treasures?
LABEL:35
VERSE:Vengeance is mine, and recompense,
VERSE:At the time when their foot shall slide:
VERSE:For the day of their calamity is at hand,
VERSE:And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.
LABEL:36
VERSE:For Jehovah will judge his people,
VERSE:And repent himself for his servants;
VERSE:When he seeth that their power is gone,
VERSE:And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.
LABEL:37
VERSE:And he will say, Where are their gods,
VERSE:The rock in which they took refuge;
LABEL:38
VERSE:Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
VERSE:And drank the wine of their drink-offering?
VERSE:Let them rise up and help you,
VERSE:Let them be your protection.
LABEL:39
VERSE:See now that I, even I, am he,
VERSE:And there is no god with me:
VERSE:I kill, and I make alive;
VERSE:I wound, and I heal;
VERSE:And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
LABEL:40
VERSE:For I lift up my hand to heaven,
VERSE:And say, As I live for ever,
LABEL:41
VERSE:If I whet my glittering sword,
VERSE:And my hand take hold on judgment;
VERSE:I will render vengeance to mine adversaries,
VERSE:And will recompense them that hate me.
LABEL:42
VERSE:I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
VERSE:And my sword shall devour flesh;
VERSE:With the blood of the slain and the captives,
VERSE:From the head of the leaders of the enemy.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people:
VERSE:For he will avenge the blood of his servants,
VERSE:And will render vengeance to his adversaries,
VERSE:And will make expiation for his land, for his people.
LABEL:44
VERSE:And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
LABEL:45
VERSE:And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
LABEL:46
VERSE:and he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, even all the words of this law.
LABEL:47
VERSE:For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
LABEL:48
VERSE:And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
LABEL:49
VERSE:Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;
LABEL:50
VERSE:and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
LABEL:51
VERSE:because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
LABEL:52
VERSE:For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.
