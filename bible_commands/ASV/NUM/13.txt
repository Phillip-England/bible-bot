VERSE:And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:
LABEL:18
VERSE:and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
LABEL:19
VERSE:and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
LABEL:20
VERSE:and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.

VERSE:And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.
LABEL:30
VERSE:And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
LABEL:31
VERSE:But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
LABEL:32
VERSE:And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
LABEL:33
VERSE:And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
