VERSE:Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.

VERSE:And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.

VERSE:And if they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.

VERSE:And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
