TITLE:Numbers 23
LABEL:1
VERSE:And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And Jehovah put a word in Balaamâ€™s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And he took up his parable, and said,
VERSE:From Aram hath Balak brought me,
VERSE:The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:
VERSE:Come, curse me Jacob,
VERSE:And come, defy Israel.
LABEL:8
VERSE:How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?
VERSE:And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?
LABEL:9
VERSE:For from the top of the rocks I see him,
VERSE:And from the hills I behold him:
VERSE:Lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone,
VERSE:And shall not be reckoned among the nations.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Who can count the dust of Jacob,
VERSE:Or number the fourth part of Israel?
VERSE:Let me die the death of the righteous,
VERSE:And let my last end be like his!
LABEL:11
VERSE:And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
LABEL:12
VERSE:And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?
LABEL:13
VERSE:And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet Jehovah yonder.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?
LABEL:18
VERSE:And he took up his parable, and said,
VERSE:Rise up, Balak, and hear;
VERSE:Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
LABEL:19
VERSE:God is not a man, that he should lie,
VERSE:Neither the son of man, that he should repent:
VERSE:Hath he said, and will he not do it?
VERSE:Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, I have received commandment to bless:
VERSE:And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob;
VERSE:Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel:
VERSE:Jehovah his God is with him,
VERSE:And the shout of a king is among them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:God bringeth them forth out of Egypt;
VERSE:He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;
VERSE:Neither is there any divination with Israel:
VERSE:Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel,
VERSE:What hath God wrought!
LABEL:24
VERSE:Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness,
VERSE:And as a lion doth he lift himself up:
VERSE:He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,
VERSE:And drink the blood of the slain.
LABEL:25
VERSE:And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
LABEL:26
VERSE:But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?
LABEL:27
VERSE:And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
LABEL:28
VERSE:And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.
LABEL:29
VERSE:And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
LABEL:30
VERSE:And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
