CHAPTER:10
TITLE:John 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
LABEL:2
VERSE:But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
LABEL:3
VERSE:To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
LABEL:4
VERSE:When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
LABEL:6
VERSE:This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
LABEL:8
VERSE:All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them:
LABEL:13
VERSE:he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,
LABEL:15
VERSE:even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
LABEL:18
VERSE:No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.
LABEL:19
VERSE:There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.
LABEL:20
VERSE:And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
LABEL:22
VERSE:And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:
LABEL:23
VERSE:it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.
LABEL:26
VERSE:But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.
LABEL:27
VERSE:My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
LABEL:28
VERSE:and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.
LABEL:29
VERSE:My Father, who hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I and the Father are one.
LABEL:31
VERSE:The Jews took up stones again to stone him.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
LABEL:33
VERSE:The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
LABEL:35
VERSE:If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),
LABEL:36
VERSE:say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
LABEL:37
VERSE:If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
LABEL:38
VERSE:But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
LABEL:39
VERSE:They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.
LABEL:40
VERSE:And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.
LABEL:41
VERSE:And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.
LABEL:42
VERSE:And many believed on him there.
