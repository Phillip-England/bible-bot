CHAPTER:14
TITLE:John 14
LABEL:1
VERSE:Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And whither I go, ye know the way.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
LABEL:14
VERSE:If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,
LABEL:17
VERSE:even the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
LABEL:25
VERSE:These things have I spoken unto you, while yet abiding with you.
LABEL:26
VERSE:But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
LABEL:29
VERSE:And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;
LABEL:31
VERSE:but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
