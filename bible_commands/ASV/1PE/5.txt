CHAPTER:5
TITLE:1 Peter 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
LABEL:2
VERSE:Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
LABEL:3
VERSE:neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
LABEL:7
VERSE:casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
LABEL:9
VERSE:whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.
LABEL:11
VERSE:To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
LABEL:12
VERSE:By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein.
LABEL:13
VERSE:She that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Salute one another with a kiss of love.
VERSE:Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.
