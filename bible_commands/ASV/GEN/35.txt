VERSE:And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:
LABEL:3
VERSE:and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
LABEL:6
VERSE:So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.

VERSE:And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
LABEL:11
VERSE:And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
LABEL:12
VERSE:and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
LABEL:19
VERSE:And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).

LABEL:24
VERSE:the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
LABEL:25
VERSE:and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;

VERSE:and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.
LABEL:27
VERSE:And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
LABEL:28
VERSE:And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
