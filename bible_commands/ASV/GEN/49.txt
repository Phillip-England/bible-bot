CHAPTER:49
TITLE:Genesis 49
LABEL:1
VERSE:And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;
VERSE:And hearken unto Israel your father.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength;
VERSE:The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence;
VERSE:Because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed;
VERSE:Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Simeon and Levi are brethren;
VERSE:Weapons of violence are their swords.
LABEL:6
VERSE:O my soul, come not thou into their council;
VERSE:Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united;
VERSE:For in their anger they slew a man,
VERSE:And in their self-will they hocked an ox.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
VERSE:And their wrath, for it was cruel:
VERSE:I will divide them in Jacob,
VERSE:And scatter them in Israel.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise:
VERSE:Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies;
VERSE:Thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Judah is a lion’s whelp;
VERSE:From the prey, my son, thou art gone up:
VERSE:He stooped down, he couched as a lion,
VERSE:And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
LABEL:10
VERSE:The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
VERSE:Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
VERSE:Until Shiloh come;
VERSE:And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Binding his foal unto the vine,
VERSE:And his ass’s colt unto the choice vine;
VERSE:He hath washed his garments in wine,
VERSE:And his vesture in the blood of grapes:
LABEL:12
VERSE:His eyes shall be red with wine,
VERSE:And his teeth white with milk.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea;
VERSE:And he shall be for a haven of ships;
VERSE:And his border shall be upon Sidon.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Issachar is a strong ass,
VERSE:Couching down between the sheepfolds:
LABEL:15
VERSE:And he saw a resting-place that it was good,
VERSE:And the land that it was pleasant;
VERSE:And he bowed his shoulder to bear,
VERSE:And became a servant under taskwork.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Dan shall judge his people,
VERSE:As one of the tribes of Israel.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Dan shall be a serpent in the way,
VERSE:An adder in the path,
VERSE:That biteth the horse’s heels,
VERSE:So that his rider falleth backward.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Gad, a troop shall press upon him;
VERSE:But he shall press upon their heel.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Out of Asher his bread shall be fat,
VERSE:And he shall yield royal dainties.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Naphtali is a hind let loose:
VERSE:He giveth goodly words.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Joseph is a fruitful bough,
VERSE:A fruitful bough by a fountain;
VERSE:His branches run over the wall.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The archers have sorely grieved him,
VERSE:And shot at him, and persecuted him:
LABEL:24
VERSE:But his bow abode in strength,
VERSE:And the arms of his hands were made strong,
VERSE:By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob
VERSE:(From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
LABEL:25
VERSE:Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee,
VERSE:And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee,
VERSE:With blessings of heaven above,
VERSE:Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath,
VERSE:Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The blessings of thy father
VERSE:Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors
VERSE:Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:
VERSE:They shall be on the head of Joseph,
VERSE:And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth:
VERSE:In the morning he shall devour the prey,
VERSE:And at even he shall divide the spoil.
LABEL:28
VERSE:All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
LABEL:29
VERSE:And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
LABEL:30
VERSE:in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
LABEL:31
VERSE:There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah—
LABEL:32
VERSE:the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.
LABEL:33
VERSE:And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
