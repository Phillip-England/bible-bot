LABEL:20
VERSE:and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
LABEL:21
VERSE:And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren: and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
LABEL:22
VERSE:And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And Jehovah said unto her,
VERSE:Two nations are in thy womb,
VERSE:And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels:
VERSE:And the one people shall be stronger than the other people;
VERSE:And the elder shall serve the younger.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
LABEL:25
VERSE:And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
LABEL:26
VERSE:And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
LABEL:27
VERSE:And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob.
LABEL:29
VERSE:And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:
LABEL:30
VERSE:and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
LABEL:31
VERSE:And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.
LABEL:32
VERSE:And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me?
LABEL:33
VERSE:And Jacob said, Swear to me first; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
LABEL:34
VERSE:And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.
