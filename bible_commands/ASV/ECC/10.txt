VERSE:If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.

VERSE:He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.
LABEL:10
VERSE:If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

LABEL:16
VERSE:Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
LABEL:17
VERSE:Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
LABEL:18

LABEL:20
VERSE:Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
