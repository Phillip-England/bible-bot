CHAPTER:27
TITLE:Proverbs 27
LABEL:1
VERSE:Boast not thyself of to-morrow;
VERSE:For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
VERSE:A stranger, and not thine own lips.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
VERSE:But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming;
VERSE:But who is able to stand before jealousy?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Better is open rebuke
VERSE:Than love that is hidden.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
VERSE:But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The full soul loatheth a honeycomb;
VERSE:But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
LABEL:8
VERSE:As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
VERSE:So is a man that wandereth from his place.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Oil and perfume rejoice the heart;
VERSE:So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend that cometh of hearty counsel.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not;
VERSE:And go not to thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity:
VERSE:Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
VERSE:That I may answer him that reproacheth me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself;
VERSE:But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
VERSE:And hold him in pledge that is surety for a foreign woman.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
VERSE:It shall be counted a curse to him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:A continual dropping in a very rainy day
VERSE:And a contentious woman are alike:
LABEL:16
VERSE:He that would restrain her restraineth the wind;
VERSE:And his right hand encountereth oil.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Iron sharpeneth iron;
VERSE:So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof;
VERSE:And he that regardeth his master shall be honored.
LABEL:19
VERSE:As in water face answereth to face,
VERSE:So the heart of man to man.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;
VERSE:And the eyes of man are never satisfied.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
VERSE:And a man is tried by his praise.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain,
VERSE:Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
VERSE:And look well to thy herds:
LABEL:24
VERSE:For riches are not for ever;
VERSE:And doth the crown endure unto all generations?
LABEL:25
VERSE:The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself,
VERSE:And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The lambs are for thy clothing,
VERSE:And the goats are the price of the field;
LABEL:27
VERSE:And there will be goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household,
VERSE:And maintenance for thy maidens.
