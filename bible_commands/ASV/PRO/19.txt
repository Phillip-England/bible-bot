CHAPTER:19
TITLE:Proverbs 19
LABEL:1
VERSE:Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity
VERSE:Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good;
VERSE:And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The foolishness of man subverteth his way;
VERSE:And his heart fretteth against Jehovah.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Wealth addeth many friends;
VERSE:But the poor is separated from his friend.
LABEL:5
VERSE:A false witness shall not be unpunished;
VERSE:And he that uttereth lies shall not escape.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man;
VERSE:And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
LABEL:7
VERSE:All the brethren of the poor do hate him:
VERSE:How much more do his friends go far from him!
VERSE:He pursueth them with words, but they are gone.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:
VERSE:He that keepeth understanding shall find good.
LABEL:9
VERSE:A false witness shall not be unpunished;
VERSE:And he that uttereth lies shall perish.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Delicate living is not seemly for a fool;
VERSE:Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger;
VERSE:And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion;
VERSE:But his favor is as dew upon the grass.
LABEL:13
VERSE:A foolish son is the calamity of his father;
VERSE:And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
LABEL:14
VERSE:House and riches are an inheritance from fathers;
VERSE:But a prudent wife is from Jehovah.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
VERSE:And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul;
VERSE:But he that is careless of his ways shall die.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah,
VERSE:And his good deed will he pay him again.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope;
VERSE:And set not thy heart on his destruction.
LABEL:19
VERSE:A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty;
VERSE:For if thou deliver him, thou must do it yet again.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Hear counsel, and receive instruction,
VERSE:That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
LABEL:21
VERSE:There are many devices in a man’s heart;
VERSE:But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand.
LABEL:22
VERSE:That which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness;
VERSE:And a poor man is better than a liar.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The fear of Jehovah tendeth to life;
VERSE:And he that hath it shall abide satisfied;
VERSE:He shall not be visited with evil.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish,
VERSE:And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Smite a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
VERSE:And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He that doeth violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother,
VERSE:Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Cease, my son, to hear instruction
VERSE:Only to err from the words of knowledge.
LABEL:28
VERSE:A worthless witness mocketh at justice;
VERSE:And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Judgments are prepared for scoffers,
VERSE:And stripes for the back of fools.
