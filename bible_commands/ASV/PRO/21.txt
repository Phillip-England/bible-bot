VERSE:Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice.
LABEL:4
VERSE:A high look, and a proud heart,

VERSE:Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away,
VERSE:Because they refuse to do justice.

VERSE:The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked;

LABEL:9
VERSE:It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,

LABEL:14
VERSE:A gift in secret pacifieth anger;

LABEL:15
VERSE:It is joy to the righteous to do justice;
VERSE:But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding
VERSE:Shall rest in the assembly of the dead.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man:

LABEL:18
VERSE:The wicked is a ransom for the righteous;
VERSE:And the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright.
LABEL:19
VERSE:It is better to dwell in a desert land,
VERSE:Than with a contentious and fretful woman.
LABEL:20

VERSE:Findeth life, righteousness, and honor.

LABEL:28
VERSE:A false witness shall perish;
VERSE:But the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure.
LABEL:29

VERSE:But as for the upright, he establisheth his ways.
LABEL:30

VERSE:Nor counsel against Jehovah.
