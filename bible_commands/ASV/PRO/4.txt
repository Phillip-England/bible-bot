TITLE:Proverbs 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father,
VERSE:And attend to know understanding:
LABEL:2
VERSE:For I give you good doctrine;
VERSE:Forsake ye not my law.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I was a son unto my father,
VERSE:Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And he taught me, and said unto me:
VERSE:Let thy heart retain my words;
VERSE:Keep my commandments, and live;
LABEL:5
VERSE:Get wisdom, get understanding;
VERSE:Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
LABEL:6
VERSE:Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee;
VERSE:Love her, and she will keep thee.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom;
VERSE:Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Exalt her, and she will promote thee;
VERSE:She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.
LABEL:9
VERSE:She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace;
VERSE:A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
VERSE:And the years of thy life shall be many.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;
VERSE:I have led thee in paths of uprightness.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;
VERSE:And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go:
VERSE:Keep her; for she is thy life.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Enter not into the path of the wicked,
VERSE:And walk not in the way of evil men.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Avoid it, pass not by it;
VERSE:Turn from it, and pass on.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For they sleep not, except they do evil;
VERSE:And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For they eat the bread of wickedness,
VERSE:And drink the wine of violence.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light,
VERSE:That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The way of the wicked is as darkness:
VERSE:They know not at what they stumble.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My son, attend to my words;
VERSE:Incline thine ear unto my sayings.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Let them not depart from thine eyes;
VERSE:Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For they are life unto those that find them,
VERSE:And health to all their flesh.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Keep thy heart with all diligence;
VERSE:For out of it are the issues of life.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Put away from thee a wayward mouth,
VERSE:And perverse lips put far from thee.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let thine eyes look right on,
VERSE:And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Make level the path of thy feet,
VERSE:And let all thy ways be established.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
VERSE:Remove thy foot from evil.
