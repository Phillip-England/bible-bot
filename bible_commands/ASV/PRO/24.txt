CHAPTER:24
TITLE:Proverbs 24
LABEL:1
VERSE:Be not thou envious against evil men;
VERSE:Neither desire to be with them:
LABEL:2
VERSE:For their heart studieth oppression,
VERSE:And their lips talk of mischief.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Through wisdom is a house builded;
VERSE:And by understanding it is established;
LABEL:4
VERSE:And by knowledge are the chambers filled
VERSE:With all precious and pleasant riches.
LABEL:5
VERSE:A wise man is strong;
VERSE:Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth might.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For by wise guidance thou shalt make thy war;
VERSE:And in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wisdom is too high for a fool:
VERSE:He openeth not his mouth in the gate.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He that deviseth to do evil,
VERSE:Men shall call him a mischief-maker.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The thought of foolishness is sin;
VERSE:And the scoffer is an abomination to men.
LABEL:10
VERSE:If thou faint in the day of adversity,
VERSE:Thy strength is small.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Deliver them that are carried away unto death,
VERSE:And those that are ready to be slain see that thou hold back.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If thou sayest, Behold, we knew not this;
VERSE:Doth not he that weigheth the hearts consider it?
VERSE:And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?
VERSE:And shall not he render to every man according to his work?
LABEL:13
VERSE:My son, eat thou honey, for it is good;
VERSE:And the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to thy taste:
LABEL:14
VERSE:So shalt thou know wisdom to be unto thy soul;
VERSE:If thou hast found it, then shall there be a reward,
VERSE:And thy hope shall not be cut off.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous;
VERSE:Destroy not his resting-place:
LABEL:16
VERSE:For a righteous man falleth seven times, and riseth up again;
VERSE:But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
VERSE:And let not thy heart be glad when he is overthrown;
LABEL:18
VERSE:Lest Jehovah see it, and it displease him,
VERSE:And he turn away his wrath from him.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Fret not thyself because of evil-doers;
VERSE:Neither be thou envious at the wicked:
LABEL:20
VERSE:For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
VERSE:The lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
LABEL:21
VERSE:My son, fear thou Jehovah and the king;
VERSE:And company not with them that are given to change:
LABEL:22
VERSE:For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
VERSE:And the destruction from them both, who knoweth it?
LABEL:23
VERSE:These also are sayings of the wise.
VERSE:To have respect of persons in judgment is not good.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous,
VERSE:Peoples shall curse him, nations shall abhor him;
LABEL:25
VERSE:But to them that rebuke him shall be delight,
VERSE:And a good blessing shall come upon them.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He kisseth the lips
VERSE:Who giveth a right answer.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Prepare thy work without,
VERSE:And make it ready for thee in the field;
VERSE:And afterwards build thy house.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause;
VERSE:And deceive not with thy lips.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me;
VERSE:I will render to the man according to his work.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I went by the field of the sluggard,
VERSE:And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
LABEL:31
VERSE:And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,
VERSE:The face thereof was covered with nettles,
VERSE:And the stone wall thereof was broken down.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Then I beheld, and considered well;
VERSE:I saw, and received instruction:
LABEL:33
VERSE:  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
VERSE:A little folding of the hands to sleep;
LABEL:34
VERSE:So shall thy poverty come as a robber,
VERSE:And thy want as an armed man.
