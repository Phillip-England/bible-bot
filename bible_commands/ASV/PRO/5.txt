CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Proverbs 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, attend unto my wisdom;
VERSE:Incline thine ear to my understanding:
LABEL:2
VERSE:That thou mayest preserve discretion,
VERSE:And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,
VERSE:And her mouth is smoother than oil:
LABEL:4
VERSE:But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
VERSE:Sharp as a two-edged sword.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Her feet go down to death;
VERSE:Her steps take hold on Sheol;
LABEL:6
VERSE:So that she findeth not the level path of life:
VERSE:Her ways are unstable, and she knoweth it not.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me,
VERSE:And depart not from the words of my mouth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Remove thy way far from her,
VERSE:And come not nigh the door of her house;
LABEL:9
VERSE:Lest thou give thine honor unto others,
VERSE:And thy years unto the cruel;
LABEL:10
VERSE:Lest strangers be filled with thy strength,
VERSE:And thy labors be in the house of an alien,
LABEL:11
VERSE:And thou mourn at thy latter end,
VERSE:When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
LABEL:12
VERSE:And say, How have I hated instruction,
VERSE:And my heart despised reproof;
LABEL:13
VERSE:Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,
VERSE:Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
LABEL:14
VERSE:I was well-nigh in all evil
VERSE:In the midst of the assembly and congregation.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
VERSE:And running waters out of thine own well.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Should thy springs be dispersed abroad,
VERSE:And streams of water in the streets?
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let them be for thyself alone,
VERSE:And not for strangers with thee.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Let thy fountain be blessed;
VERSE:And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.
LABEL:19
VERSE:  As a loving hind and a pleasant doe,
VERSE:Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
VERSE:And be thou ravished always with her love.
LABEL:20
VERSE:For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
VERSE:And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah;
VERSE:And he maketh level all his paths.
LABEL:22
VERSE:His own iniquities shall take the wicked,
VERSE:And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He shall die for lack of instruction;
VERSE:And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
