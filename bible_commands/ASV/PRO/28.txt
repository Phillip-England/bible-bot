CHAPTER:28
TITLE:Proverbs 28
LABEL:1
VERSE:The wicked flee when no man pursueth;
VERSE:But the righteous are bold as a lion.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof;
VERSE:But by men of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A needy man that oppresseth the poor
VERSE:Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They that forsake the law praise the wicked;
VERSE:But such as keep the law contend with them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Evil men understand not justice;
VERSE:But they that seek Jehovah understand all things.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity,
VERSE:Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son;
VERSE:But he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase,
VERSE:Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
VERSE:Even his prayer is an abomination.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way,
VERSE:He shall fall himself into his own pit;
VERSE:But the perfect shall inherit good.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The rich man is wise in his own conceit;
VERSE:But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;
VERSE:But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper;
VERSE:But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Happy is the man that feareth alway;
VERSE:But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
LABEL:15
VERSE:  As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear,
VERSE:So is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor;
VERSE:But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
LABEL:17
VERSE:A man that is laden with the blood of any person
VERSE:Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered;
VERSE:But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread;
VERSE:But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
LABEL:20
VERSE:A faithful man shall abound with blessings;
VERSE:But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.
LABEL:21
VERSE:To have respect of persons is not good;
VERSE:Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches,
VERSE:And knoweth not that want shall come upon him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor
VERSE:Than he that flattereth with the tongue.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression,
VERSE:The same is the companion of a destroyer.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife;
VERSE:But he that putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool;
VERSE:But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack;
VERSE:But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
LABEL:28
VERSE:When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;
VERSE:But when they perish, the righteous increase.
