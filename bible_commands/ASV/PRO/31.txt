CHAPTER:31
TITLE:Proverbs 31
LABEL:1
VERSE:The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
LABEL:2
VERSE:What, my son? and what, O son of my womb?
VERSE:And what, O son of my vows?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Give not thy strength unto women,
VERSE:Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
LABEL:4
VERSE:It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;
VERSE:Nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Lest they drink, and forget the law,
VERSE:And pervert the justice due to any that is afflicted.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
VERSE:And wine unto the bitter in soul:
LABEL:7
VERSE:Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
VERSE:And remember his misery no more.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Open thy mouth for the dumb,
VERSE:In the cause of all such as are left desolate.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Open thy mouth, judge righteously,
VERSE:And minister justice to the poor and needy.
LABEL:10
VERSE:A worthy woman who can find?
VERSE:For her price is far above rubies.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The heart of her husband trusteth in her,
VERSE:And he shall have no lack of gain.
LABEL:12
VERSE:She doeth him good and not evil
VERSE:All the days of her life.
LABEL:13
VERSE:She seeketh wool and flax,
VERSE:And worketh willingly with her hands.
LABEL:14
VERSE:She is like the merchant-ships;
VERSE:She bringeth her bread from afar.
LABEL:15
VERSE:She riseth also while it is yet night,
VERSE:And giveth food to her household,
VERSE:And their task to her maidens.
LABEL:16
VERSE:She considereth a field, and buyeth it;
VERSE:With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
LABEL:17
VERSE:She girdeth her loins with strength,
VERSE:And maketh strong her arms.
LABEL:18
VERSE:She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable;
VERSE:Her lamp goeth not out by night.
LABEL:19
VERSE:She layeth her hands to the distaff,
VERSE:And her hands hold the spindle.
LABEL:20
VERSE:She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;
VERSE:Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
LABEL:21
VERSE:She is not afraid of the snow for her household;
VERSE:For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
LABEL:22
VERSE:She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry;
VERSE:Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Her husband is known in the gates,
VERSE:When he sitteth among the elders of the land.
LABEL:24
VERSE:She maketh linen garments and selleth them,
VERSE:And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Strength and dignity are her clothing;
VERSE:And she laugheth at the time to come.
LABEL:26
VERSE:She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
VERSE:And the law of kindness is on her tongue.
LABEL:27
VERSE:She looketh well to the ways of her household,
VERSE:And eateth not the bread of idleness.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Her children rise up, and call her blessed;
VERSE:Her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying:
LABEL:29
VERSE:Many daughters have done worthily,
VERSE:But thou excellest them all.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain;
VERSE:But a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Give her of the fruit of her hands;
VERSE:And let her works praise her in the gates.
