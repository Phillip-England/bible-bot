CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Proverbs 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, keep my words,
VERSE:And lay up my commandments with thee.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Keep my commandments and live;
VERSE:And my law as the apple of thine eye.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Bind them upon thy fingers;
VERSE:Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister;
VERSE:And call understanding thy kinswoman:
LABEL:5
VERSE:That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
VERSE:From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For at the window of my house
VERSE:I looked forth through my lattice;
LABEL:7
VERSE:And I beheld among the simple ones,
VERSE:I discerned among the youths,
VERSE:A young man void of understanding,
LABEL:8
VERSE:Passing through the street near her corner;
VERSE:And he went the way to her house,
LABEL:9
VERSE:In the twilight, in the evening of the day,
VERSE:In the middle of the night and in the darkness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And, behold, there met him a woman
VERSE:With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.
LABEL:11
VERSE:(She is clamorous and wilful;
VERSE:Her feet abide not in her house:
LABEL:12
VERSE:Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places,
VERSE:And lieth in wait at every corner.)
LABEL:13
VERSE:So she caught him, and kissed him,
VERSE:And with an impudent face she said unto him:
LABEL:14
VERSE:Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me;
VERSE:This day have I paid my vows.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
VERSE:Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,
VERSE:With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I have perfumed my bed
VERSE:With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning;
VERSE:Let us solace ourselves with loves.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For the man is not at home;
VERSE:He is gone a long journey:
LABEL:20
VERSE:He hath taken a bag of money with him;
VERSE:He will come home at the full moon.
LABEL:21
VERSE:With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield;
VERSE:With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He goeth after her straightway,
VERSE:As an ox goeth to the slaughter,
VERSE:Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;
LABEL:23
VERSE:Till an arrow strike through his liver;
VERSE:As a bird hasteth to the snare,
VERSE:And knoweth not that it is for his life.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me,
VERSE:And attend to the words of my mouth.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let not thy heart decline to her ways;
VERSE:Go not astray in her paths.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For she hath cast down many wounded:
VERSE:Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Her house is the way to Sheol,
VERSE:Going down to the chambers of death.
