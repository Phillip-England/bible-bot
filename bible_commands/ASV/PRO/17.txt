CHAPTER:17
TITLE:Proverbs 17
LABEL:1
VERSE:Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
VERSE:Than a house full of feasting with strife.
LABEL:2
VERSE:A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
VERSE:And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
VERSE:But Jehovah trieth the hearts.
LABEL:4
VERSE:An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips;
VERSE:And a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker;
VERSE:And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men;
VERSE:And the glory of children are their fathers.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Excellent speech becometh not a fool;
VERSE:Much less do lying lips a prince.
LABEL:8
VERSE:A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it;
VERSE:Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
VERSE:But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends.
LABEL:10
VERSE:A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding
VERSE:Than a hundred stripes into a fool.
LABEL:11
VERSE:An evil man seeketh only rebellion;
VERSE:Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
VERSE:Rather than a fool in his folly.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
VERSE:Evil shall not depart from his house.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
VERSE:Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous,
VERSE:Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
VERSE:Seeing he hath no understanding?
LABEL:17
VERSE:A friend loveth at all times;
VERSE:And a brother is born for adversity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:A man void of understanding striketh hands,
VERSE:And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
VERSE:He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He that hath a wayward heart findeth no good;
VERSE:And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow;
VERSE:And the father of a fool hath no joy.
LABEL:22
VERSE:A cheerful heart is a good medicine;
VERSE:But a broken spirit drieth up the bones.
LABEL:23
VERSE:A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom,
VERSE:To pervert the ways of justice.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding;
VERSE:But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
LABEL:25
VERSE:A foolish son is a grief to his father,
VERSE:And bitterness to her that bare him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Also to punish the righteous is not good,
VERSE:Nor to smite the noble for their uprightness.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He that spareth his words hath knowledge;
VERSE:And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise;
VERSE:When he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.
