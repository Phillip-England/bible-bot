LABEL:6
VERSE:Train up a child in the way he should go,
VERSE:And even when he is old he will not depart from it.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The rich ruleth over the poor;
VERSE:And the borrower is servant to the lender.

LABEL:9
VERSE:He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;

VERSE:The sluggard saith, There is a lion without;
VERSE:I shall be slain in the streets.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The mouth of strange women is a deep pit;

LABEL:15
VERSE:Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;
VERSE:But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.

VERSE:And he that giveth to the rich, shall come only to want.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,
VERSE:And apply thy heart unto my knowledge.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee,
VERSE:If they be established together upon thy lips.

VERSE:That thy trust may be in Jehovah,
VERSE:I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Have not I written unto thee excellent things
VERSE:Of counsels and knowledge,
LABEL:21
VERSE:To make thee know the certainty of the words of truth,
VERSE:That thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee?
LABEL:22

VERSE:For Jehovah will plead their cause,
VERSE:And despoil of life those that despoil them.

VERSE:Which thy fathers have set.
