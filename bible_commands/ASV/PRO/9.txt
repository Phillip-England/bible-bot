CHAPTER:9
TITLE:Proverbs 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:Wisdom hath builded her house;
VERSE:She hath hewn out her seven pillars:
LABEL:2
VERSE:She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;
VERSE:She hath also furnished her table:
LABEL:3
VERSE:She hath sent forth her maidens;
VERSE:She crieth upon the highest places of the city:
LABEL:4
VERSE:Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
VERSE:As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
LABEL:5
VERSE:Come, eat ye of my bread,
VERSE:And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Leave off, ye simple ones, and live;
VERSE:And walk in the way of understanding.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling;
VERSE:And he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee:
VERSE:Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
VERSE:Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom;
VERSE:And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
VERSE:And the years of thy life shall be increased.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself;
VERSE:And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The foolish woman is clamorous;
VERSE:She is simple, and knoweth nothing.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And she sitteth at the door of her house,
VERSE:On a seat in the high places of the city,
LABEL:15
VERSE:To call to them that pass by,
VERSE:Who go right on their ways:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither;
VERSE:And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Stolen waters are sweet,
VERSE:And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But he knoweth not that the dead are there;
VERSE:That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
