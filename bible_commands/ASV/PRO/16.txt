CHAPTER:16
TITLE:Proverbs 16
LABEL:1
VERSE:The plans of the heart belong to man;
VERSE:But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah.
LABEL:2
VERSE:All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;
VERSE:But Jehovah weigheth the spirits.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Commit thy works unto Jehovah,
VERSE:And thy purposes shall be established.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Jehovah hath made everything for its own end;
VERSE:Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah:
VERSE:Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
LABEL:6
VERSE:By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for;
VERSE:And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil.
LABEL:7
VERSE:When a man’s ways please Jehovah,
VERSE:He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Better is a little, with righteousness,
VERSE:Than great revenues with injustice.
LABEL:9
VERSE:A man’s heart deviseth his way;
VERSE:But Jehovah directeth his steps.
LABEL:10
VERSE:A divine sentence is in the lips of the king;
VERSE:His mouth shall not transgress in judgment.
LABEL:11
VERSE:A just balance and scales are Jehovah’s;
VERSE:All the weights of the bag are his work.
LABEL:12
VERSE:It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness;
VERSE:For the throne is established by righteousness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Righteous lips are the delight of kings;
VERSE:And they love him that speaketh right.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The wrath of a king is as messengers of death;
VERSE:But a wise man will pacify it.
LABEL:15
VERSE:In the light of the king’s countenance is life;
VERSE:And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.
LABEL:16
VERSE:How much better is it to get wisdom than gold!
VERSE:Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The highway of the upright is to depart from evil:
VERSE:He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Pride goeth before destruction,
VERSE:And a haughty spirit before a fall.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,
VERSE:Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good;
VERSE:And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The wise in heart shall be called prudent;
VERSE:And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it;
VERSE:But the correction of fools is their folly.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth,
VERSE:And addeth learning to his lips.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Pleasant words are as a honeycomb,
VERSE:Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
LABEL:25
VERSE:There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
VERSE:But the end thereof are the ways of death.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him;
VERSE:For his mouth urgeth him thereto.
LABEL:27
VERSE:A worthless man deviseth mischief;
VERSE:And in his lips there is as a scorching fire.
LABEL:28
VERSE:A perverse man scattereth abroad strife;
VERSE:And a whisperer separateth chief friends.
LABEL:29
VERSE:A man of violence enticeth his neighbor,
VERSE:And leadeth him in a way that is not good.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise perverse things:
VERSE:He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass.
LABEL:31
VERSE:The hoary head is a crown of glory;
VERSE:It shall be found in the way of righteousness.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
VERSE:And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.
LABEL:33
VERSE:The lot is cast into the lap;
VERSE:But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah.
