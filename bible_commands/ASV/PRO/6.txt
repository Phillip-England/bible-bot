CHAPTER:6
TITLE:Proverbs 6
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor,
VERSE:If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
VERSE:Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,
VERSE:Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor:
VERSE:Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;
LABEL:4
VERSE:Give not sleep to thine eyes,
VERSE:Nor slumber to thine eyelids;
LABEL:5
VERSE:Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter,
VERSE:And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
VERSE:Consider her ways, and be wise:
LABEL:7
VERSE:Which having no chief,
VERSE:Overseer, or ruler,
LABEL:8
VERSE:Provideth her bread in the summer,
VERSE:And gathereth her food in the harvest.
LABEL:9
VERSE:How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?
VERSE:When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
LABEL:10
VERSE:  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
VERSE:A little folding of the hands to sleep:
LABEL:11
VERSE:So shall thy poverty come as a robber,
VERSE:And thy want as an armed man.
LABEL:12
VERSE:A worthless person, a man of iniquity,
VERSE:Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;
LABEL:13
VERSE:That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet,
VERSE:That maketh signs with his fingers;
LABEL:14
VERSE:In whose heart is perverseness,
VERSE:Who deviseth evil continually,
VERSE:Who soweth discord.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
VERSE:On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.
LABEL:16
VERSE:There are six things which Jehovah hateth;
VERSE:Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:
LABEL:17
VERSE:Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
VERSE:And hands that shed innocent blood;
LABEL:18
VERSE:A heart that deviseth wicked purposes,
VERSE:Feet that are swift in running to mischief,
LABEL:19
VERSE:A false witness that uttereth lies,
VERSE:And he that soweth discord among brethren.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My son, keep the commandment of thy father,
VERSE:And forsake not the law of thy mother:
LABEL:21
VERSE:Bind them continually upon thy heart;
VERSE:Tie them about thy neck.
LABEL:22
VERSE:When thou walkest, it shall lead thee;
VERSE:When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee;
VERSE:And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light;
VERSE:And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
LABEL:24
VERSE:To keep thee from the evil woman,
VERSE:From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Lust not after her beauty in thy heart;
VERSE:Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread;
VERSE:And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Can a man take fire in his bosom,
VERSE:And his clothes not be burned?
LABEL:28
VERSE:Or can one walk upon hot coals,
VERSE:And his feet not be scorched?
LABEL:29
VERSE:So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife;
VERSE:Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Men do not despise a thief, if he steal
VERSE:To satisfy himself when he is hungry:
LABEL:31
VERSE:But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold;
VERSE:He shall give all the substance of his house.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding:
VERSE:He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Wounds and dishonor shall he get;
VERSE:And his reproach shall not be wiped away.
LABEL:34
VERSE:For jealousy is the rage of a man;
VERSE:And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
LABEL:35
VERSE:He will not regard any ransom;
VERSE:Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
