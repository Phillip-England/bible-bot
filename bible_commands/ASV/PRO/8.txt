CHAPTER:8
TITLE:Proverbs 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Doth not wisdom cry,
VERSE:And understanding put forth her voice?
LABEL:2
VERSE:On the top of high places by the way,
VERSE:Where the paths meet, she standeth;
LABEL:3
VERSE:Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,
VERSE:At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
LABEL:4
VERSE:Unto you, O men, I call;
VERSE:And my voice is to the sons of men.
LABEL:5
VERSE:O ye simple, understand prudence;
VERSE:And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Hear, for I will speak excellent things;
VERSE:And the opening of my lips shall be right things.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For my mouth shall utter truth;
VERSE:And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
LABEL:8
VERSE:All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;
VERSE:There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They are all plain to him that understandeth,
VERSE:And right to them that find knowledge.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Receive my instruction, and not silver;
VERSE:And knowledge rather than choice gold.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For wisdom is better than rubies;
VERSE:And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling,
VERSE:And find out knowledge and discretion.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil:
VERSE:Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way,
VERSE:And the perverse mouth, do I hate.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge:
VERSE:I am understanding; I have might.
LABEL:15
VERSE:By me kings reign,
VERSE:And princes decree justice.
LABEL:16
VERSE:By me princes rule,
VERSE:And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I love them that love me;
VERSE:And those that seek me diligently shall find me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Riches and honor are with me;
VERSE:Yea, durable wealth and righteousness.
LABEL:19
VERSE:My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold;
VERSE:And my revenue than choice silver.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I walk in the way of righteousness,
VERSE:In the midst of the paths of justice;
LABEL:21
VERSE:That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance,
VERSE:And that I may fill their treasuries.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way,
VERSE:Before his works of old.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
VERSE:Before the earth was.
LABEL:24
VERSE:When there were no depths, I was brought forth,
VERSE:When there were no fountains abounding with water.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Before the mountains were settled,
VERSE:Before the hills was I brought forth;
LABEL:26
VERSE:While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
VERSE:Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
LABEL:27
VERSE:When he established the heavens, I was there:
VERSE:When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,
LABEL:28
VERSE:When he made firm the skies above,
VERSE:When the fountains of the deep became strong,
LABEL:29
VERSE:When he gave to the sea its bound,
VERSE:That the waters should not transgress his commandment,
VERSE:When he marked out the foundations of the earth;
LABEL:30
VERSE:Then I was by him, as a master workman;
VERSE:And I was daily his delight,
VERSE:Rejoicing always before him,
LABEL:31
VERSE:Rejoicing in his habitable earth;
VERSE:And my delight was with the sons of men.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me;
VERSE:For blessed are they that keep my ways.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Hear instruction, and be wise,
VERSE:And refuse it not.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Blessed is the man that heareth me,
VERSE:Watching daily at my gates,
VERSE:Waiting at the posts of my doors.
LABEL:35
VERSE:For whoso findeth me findeth life,
VERSE:And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.
LABEL:36
VERSE:But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:
VERSE:All they that hate me love death.
