CHAPTER:18
TITLE:Proverbs 18
LABEL:1
VERSE:He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire,
VERSE:And rageth against all sound wisdom.
LABEL:2
VERSE:A fool hath no delight in understanding,
VERSE:But only that his heart may reveal itself.
LABEL:3
VERSE:When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt,
VERSE:And with ignominy cometh reproach.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters;
VERSE:The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook.
LABEL:5
VERSE:To respect the person of the wicked is not good,
VERSE:Nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment.
LABEL:6
VERSE:A fool’s lips enter into contention,
VERSE:And his mouth calleth for stripes.
LABEL:7
VERSE:A fool’s mouth is his destruction,
VERSE:And his lips are the snare of his soul.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
VERSE:And they go down into the innermost parts.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He also that is slack in his work
VERSE:Is brother to him that is a destroyer.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The name of Jehovah is a strong tower;
VERSE:The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
VERSE:And as a high wall in his own imagination.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Before destruction the heart of man is haughty;
VERSE:And before honor goeth humility.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He that giveth answer before he heareth,
VERSE:It is folly and shame unto him.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
VERSE:But a broken spirit who can bear?
LABEL:15
VERSE:The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;
VERSE:And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
LABEL:16
VERSE:A man’s gift maketh room for him,
VERSE:And bringeth him before great men.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just;
VERSE:But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The lot causeth contentions to cease,
VERSE:And parteth between the mighty.
LABEL:19
VERSE:A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city;
VERSE:And such contentions are like the bars of a castle.
LABEL:20
VERSE:A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth;
VERSE:With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
VERSE:And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing,
VERSE:And obtaineth favor of Jehovah.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The poor useth entreaties;
VERSE:But the rich answereth roughly.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction;
VERSE:But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
