CHAPTER:26
TITLE:Proverbs 26
LABEL:1
VERSE:As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
VERSE:So honor is not seemly for a fool.
LABEL:2
VERSE:As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying,
VERSE:So the curse that is causeless alighteth not.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
VERSE:And a rod for the back of fools.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Answer not a fool according to his folly,
VERSE:Lest thou also be like unto him.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Answer a fool according to his folly,
VERSE:Lest he be wise in his own conceit.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
VERSE:Cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh in damage.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The legs of the lame hang loose;
VERSE:So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
LABEL:8
VERSE:As one that bindeth a stone in a sling,
VERSE:So is he that giveth honor to a fool.
LABEL:9
VERSE:  As a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,
VERSE:So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
LABEL:10
VERSE:  As an archer that woundeth all,
VERSE:So is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by.
LABEL:11
VERSE:As a dog that returneth to his vomit,
VERSE:So is a fool that repeateth his folly.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
VERSE:There is more hope of a fool than of him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way;
VERSE:A lion is in the streets.
LABEL:14
VERSE:  As the door turneth upon its hinges,
VERSE:So doth the sluggard upon his bed.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish;
VERSE:It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
VERSE:Than seven men that can render a reason.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He that passeth by, and vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him,
VERSE:Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.
LABEL:18
VERSE:As a madman who casteth firebrands,
VERSE:Arrows, and death,
LABEL:19
VERSE:So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor,
VERSE:And saith, Am not I in sport?
LABEL:20
VERSE:For lack of wood the fire goeth out;
VERSE:And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:  As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire,
VERSE:So is a contentious man to inflame strife.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
VERSE:And they go down into the innermost parts.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Fervent lips and a wicked heart
VERSE:Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He that hateth dissembleth with his lips;
VERSE:But he layeth up deceit within him:
LABEL:25
VERSE:When he speaketh fair, believe him not;
VERSE:For there are seven abominations in his heart:
LABEL:26
VERSE:Though his hatred cover itself with guile,
VERSE:His wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein;
VERSE:And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.
LABEL:28
VERSE:A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded;
VERSE:And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
