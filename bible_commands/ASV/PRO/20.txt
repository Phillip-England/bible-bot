LABEL:1
VERSE:Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler;
VERSE:And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise.

VERSE:It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife;
VERSE:But every fool will be quarrelling.

VERSE:Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water;
VERSE:But a man of understanding will draw it out.

VERSE:But a faithful man who can find?
LABEL:7
VERSE:A righteous man that walketh in his integrity,
VERSE:Blessed are his children after him.

VERSE:Scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Who can say, I have made my heart clean,
VERSE:I am pure from my sin?

VERSE:Diverse weights, and diverse measures,
VERSE:Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Even a child maketh himself known by his doings,
VERSE:Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,
VERSE:Jehovah hath made even both of them.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty;
VERSE:Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
LABEL:14
VERSE:It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer;
VERSE:But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
LABEL:15
VERSE:There is gold, and abundance of rubies;
VERSE:But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
VERSE:And hold him in pledge that is surety for foreigners.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man;
VERSE:But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Every purpose is established by counsel;
VERSE:And by wise guidance make thou war.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets;
VERSE:Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
VERSE:His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.
LABEL:21
VERSE:An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning;
VERSE:But the end thereof shall not be blessed.
LABEL:22

VERSE:Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah;
VERSE:And a false balance is not good.
LABEL:24
VERSE:A manâ€™s goings are of Jehovah;
VERSE:How then can man understand his way?
LABEL:25
VERSE:It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy,
VERSE:And after vows to make inquiry.

VERSE:A wise king winnoweth the wicked,
VERSE:And bringeth the threshing-wheel over them.
LABEL:27

VERSE:Searching all his innermost parts.

VERSE:And his throne is upholden by kindness.
LABEL:29

VERSE:And the beauty of old men is the hoary head.

VERSE:Stripes that wound cleanse away evil;
VERSE:And strokes reach the innermost parts.
