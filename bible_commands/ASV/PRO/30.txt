CHAPTER:30
TITLE:Proverbs 30
LABEL:1
VERSE:The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the oracle.
VERSE:The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:
LABEL:2
VERSE:Surely I am more brutish than any man,
VERSE:And have not the understanding of a man;
LABEL:3
VERSE:And I have not learned wisdom,
VERSE:Neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended?
VERSE:Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
VERSE:Who hath bound the waters in his garment?
VERSE:Who hath established all the ends of the earth?
VERSE:What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou knowest?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Every word of God is tried:
VERSE:He is a shield unto them that take refuge in him.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Add thou not unto his words,
VERSE:Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Two things have I asked of thee;
VERSE:Deny me them not before I die:
LABEL:8
VERSE:Remove far from me falsehood and lies;
VERSE:Give me neither poverty nor riches;
VERSE:Feed me with the food that is needful for me:
LABEL:9
VERSE:Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is Jehovah?
VERSE:Or lest I be poor, and steal,
VERSE:And use profanely the name of my God.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Slander not a servant unto his master,
VERSE:Lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.
LABEL:11
VERSE:There is a generation that curse their father,
VERSE:And bless not their mother.
LABEL:12
VERSE:There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,
VERSE:And yet are not washed from their filthiness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!
VERSE:And their eyelids are lifted up.
LABEL:14
VERSE:There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives,
VERSE:To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.
VERSE:There are three things that are never satisfied,
VERSE:Yea, four that say not, Enough:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Sheol; and the barren womb;
VERSE:The earth that is not satisfied with water;
VERSE:And the fire that saith not, Enough.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The eye that mocketh at his father,
VERSE:And despiseth to obey his mother,
VERSE:The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
VERSE:And the young eagles shall eat it.
LABEL:18
VERSE:There are three things which are too wonderful for me,
VERSE:Yea, four which I know not:
LABEL:19
VERSE:The way of an eagle in the air;
VERSE:The way of a serpent upon a rock;
VERSE:The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
VERSE:And the way of a man with a maiden.
LABEL:20
VERSE:So is the way of an adulterous woman;
VERSE:She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
VERSE:And saith, I have done no wickedness.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For three things the earth doth tremble,
VERSE:And for four, which it cannot bear:
LABEL:22
VERSE:For a servant when he is king;
VERSE:And a fool when he is filled with food;
LABEL:23
VERSE:For an odious woman when she is married;
VERSE:And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
LABEL:24
VERSE:There are four things which are little upon the earth,
VERSE:But they are exceeding wise:
LABEL:25
VERSE:The ants are a people not strong,
VERSE:Yet they provide their food in the summer;
LABEL:26
VERSE:The conies are but a feeble folk,
VERSE:Yet make they their houses in the rocks;
LABEL:27
VERSE:The locusts have no king,
VERSE:Yet go they forth all of them by bands;
LABEL:28
VERSE:The lizard taketh hold with her hands,
VERSE:Yet is she in kings’ palaces.
LABEL:29
VERSE:There are three things which are stately in their march,
VERSE:Yea, four which are stately in going:
LABEL:30
VERSE:The lion, which is mightiest among beasts,
VERSE:And turneth not away for any;
LABEL:31
VERSE:The greyhound; the he-goat also;
VERSE:And the king against whom there is no rising up.
LABEL:32
VERSE:If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
VERSE:Or if thou hast thought evil,
VERSE:Lay thy hand upon thy mouth.
LABEL:33
VERSE:For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
VERSE:And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood;
VERSE:So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
