CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Proverbs 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
VERSE:And lay up my commandments with thee;
LABEL:2
VERSE:So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom,
VERSE:And apply thy heart to understanding;
LABEL:3
VERSE:Yea, if thou cry after discernment,
VERSE:And lift up thy voice for understanding;
LABEL:4
VERSE:If thou seek her as silver,
VERSE:And search for her as for hid treasures:
LABEL:5
VERSE:Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah,
VERSE:And find the knowledge of God.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For Jehovah giveth wisdom;
VERSE:Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:
LABEL:7
VERSE:He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright;
VERSE:He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;
LABEL:8
VERSE:That he may guard the paths of justice,
VERSE:And preserve the way of his saints.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice,
VERSE:And equity, yea, every good path.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For wisdom shall enter into thy heart,
VERSE:And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
LABEL:11
VERSE:Discretion shall watch over thee;
VERSE:Understanding shall keep thee:
LABEL:12
VERSE:To deliver thee from the way of evil,
VERSE:From the men that speak perverse things;
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who forsake the paths of uprightness,
VERSE:To walk in the ways of darkness;
LABEL:14
VERSE:Who rejoice to do evil,
VERSE:And delight in the perverseness of evil;
LABEL:15
VERSE:Who are crooked in their ways,
VERSE:And wayward in their paths:
LABEL:16
VERSE:To deliver thee from the strange woman,
VERSE:Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;
LABEL:17
VERSE:That forsaketh the friend of her youth,
VERSE:And forgetteth the covenant of her God:
LABEL:18
VERSE:For her house inclineth unto death,
VERSE:And her paths unto the dead;
LABEL:19
VERSE:None that go unto her return again,
VERSE:Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:
LABEL:20
VERSE:That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
VERSE:And keep the paths of the righteous.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the upright shall dwell in the land,
VERSE:And the perfect shall remain in it.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But the wicked shall be cut off from the land,
VERSE:And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.
