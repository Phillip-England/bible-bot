CHAPTER:25
TITLE:Proverbs 25
LABEL:1
VERSE:These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
LABEL:2
VERSE:It is the glory of God to conceal a thing;
VERSE:But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
LABEL:3
VERSE:As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
VERSE:So the heart of kings is unsearchable.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Take away the dross from the silver,
VERSE:And there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner:
LABEL:5
VERSE:Take away the wicked from before the king,
VERSE:And his throne shall be established in righteousness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king,
VERSE:And stand not in the place of great men:
LABEL:7
VERSE:For better is it that it be said unto thee, Come up hither,
VERSE:Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince,
VERSE:Whom thine eyes have seen.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Go not forth hastily to strive,
VERSE:Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof,
VERSE:When thy neighbor hath put thee to shame.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself,
VERSE:And disclose not the secret of another;
LABEL:10
VERSE:Lest he that heareth it revile thee,
VERSE:And thine infamy turn not away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:A word fitly spoken
VERSE:Is like apples of gold in network of silver.
LABEL:12
VERSE:  As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
VERSE:So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
LABEL:13
VERSE:As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
VERSE:So is a faithful messenger to them that send him;
VERSE:For he refresheth the soul of his masters.
LABEL:14
VERSE:  As clouds and wind without rain,
VERSE:So is he that boasteth himself of his gifts falsely.
LABEL:15
VERSE:By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded,
VERSE:And a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
VERSE:Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighborâ€™s house,
VERSE:Lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee.
LABEL:18
VERSE:A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor
VERSE:Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
VERSE:Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
LABEL:20
VERSE:  As one that taketh off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon soda,
VERSE:So is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.
LABEL:21
VERSE:If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
VERSE:And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
LABEL:22
VERSE:For thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head,
VERSE:And Jehovah will reward thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The north wind bringeth forth rain;
VERSE:So doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.
LABEL:24
VERSE:It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
VERSE:Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
LABEL:25
VERSE:  As cold waters to a thirsty soul,
VERSE:So is good news from a far country.
LABEL:26
VERSE:  As a troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring,
VERSE:So is a righteous man that giveth way before the wicked.
LABEL:27
VERSE:It is not good to eat much honey;
VERSE:So for men to search out their own glory is grievous.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He whose spirit is without restraint
VERSE:Is like a city that is broken down and without walls.
