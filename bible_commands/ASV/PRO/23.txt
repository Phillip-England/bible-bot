CHAPTER:23
TITLE:Proverbs 23
LABEL:1
VERSE:When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
VERSE:Consider diligently him that is before thee;
LABEL:2
VERSE:And put a knife to thy throat,
VERSE:If thou be a man given to appetite.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Be not desirous of his dainties;
VERSE:Seeing they are deceitful food.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Weary not thyself to be rich;
VERSE:Cease from thine own wisdom.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?
VERSE:For riches certainly make themselves wings,
VERSE:Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye,
VERSE:Neither desire thou his dainties:
LABEL:7
VERSE:For as he thinketh within himself, so is he:
VERSE:Eat and drink, saith he to thee;
VERSE:But his heart is not with thee.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up,
VERSE:And lose thy sweet words.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Speak not in the hearing of a fool;
VERSE:For he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Remove not the ancient landmark;
VERSE:And enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
LABEL:11
VERSE:For their Redeemer is strong;
VERSE:He will plead their cause against thee.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Apply thy heart unto instruction,
VERSE:And thine ears to the words of knowledge.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Withhold not correction from the child;
VERSE:For if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thou shalt beat him with the rod,
VERSE:And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My son, if thy heart be wise,
VERSE:My heart will be glad, even mine:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yea, my heart will rejoice,
VERSE:When thy lips speak right things.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let not thy heart envy sinners;
VERSE:But be thou in the fear of Jehovah all the day long:
LABEL:18
VERSE:For surely there is a reward;
VERSE:And thy hope shall not be cut off.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Hear thou, my son, and be wise,
VERSE:And guide thy heart in the way.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Be not among winebibbers,
VERSE:Among gluttonous eaters of flesh:
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty;
VERSE:And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,
VERSE:And despise not thy mother when she is old.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Buy the truth, and sell it not;
VERSE:Yea, wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
VERSE:And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let thy father and thy mother be glad,
VERSE:And let her that bare thee rejoice.
LABEL:26
VERSE:My son, give me thy heart;
VERSE:And let thine eyes delight in my ways.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For a harlot is a deep ditch;
VERSE:And a foreign woman is a narrow pit.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber,
VERSE:And increaseth the treacherous among men.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions?
VERSE:Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause?
VERSE:Who hath redness of eyes?
LABEL:30
VERSE:They that tarry long at the wine;
VERSE:They that go to seek out mixed wine.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
VERSE:When it sparkleth in the cup,
VERSE:When it goeth down smoothly:
LABEL:32
VERSE:At the last it biteth like a serpent,
VERSE:And stingeth like an adder.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Thine eyes shall behold strange things,
VERSE:And thy heart shall utter perverse things.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
VERSE:Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
LABEL:35
VERSE:They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not hurt;
VERSE:They have beaten me, and I felt it not:
VERSE:When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
