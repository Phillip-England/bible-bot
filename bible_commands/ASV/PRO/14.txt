VERSE:Go into the presence of a foolish man,
VERSE:And thou shalt not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.

LABEL:15
VERSE:The simple believeth every word;
VERSE:But the prudent man looketh well to his going.
LABEL:16
VERSE:A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil;

LABEL:19
VERSE:The evil bow down before the good;

LABEL:22
VERSE:Do they not err that devise evil?
VERSE:But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.

VERSE:A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh;
VERSE:But envy is the rottenness of the bones.

LABEL:32
VERSE:The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing;
VERSE:But the righteous hath a refuge in his death.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding;
VERSE:But that which is in the inward part of fools is made known.

LABEL:35
VERSE:The king’s favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely;
