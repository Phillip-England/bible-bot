TITLE:Ephesians 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,â€”
LABEL:2
VERSE:if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;
LABEL:3
VERSE:how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,
LABEL:4
VERSE:whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
LABEL:5
VERSE:which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
LABEL:6
VERSE:to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
LABEL:7
VERSE:whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
LABEL:9
VERSE:and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;
LABEL:10
VERSE:to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,
LABEL:11
VERSE:according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
LABEL:12
VERSE:in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,
LABEL:15
VERSE:from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
LABEL:16
VERSE:that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;
LABEL:17
VERSE:that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
LABEL:18
VERSE:may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
LABEL:19
VERSE:and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
LABEL:21
VERSE:unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.
