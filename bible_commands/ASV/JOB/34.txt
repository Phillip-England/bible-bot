CHAPTER:34
TITLE:Job 34
LABEL:1
VERSE:Moreover Elihu answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear my words, ye wise men;
VERSE:And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the ear trieth words,
VERSE:As the palate tasteth food.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let us choose for us that which is right:
VERSE:Let us know among ourselves what is good.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For Job hath said, I am righteous,
VERSE:And God hath taken away my right:
LABEL:6
VERSE:Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar;
VERSE:My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.
LABEL:7
VERSE:What man is like Job,
VERSE:Who drinketh up scoffing like water,
LABEL:8
VERSE:Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
VERSE:And walketh with wicked men?
LABEL:9
VERSE:For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing
VERSE:That he should delight himself with God.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
VERSE:Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,
VERSE:And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For the work of a man will he render unto him,
VERSE:And cause every man to find according to his ways.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,
VERSE:Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who gave him a charge over the earth?
VERSE:Or who hath disposed the whole world?
LABEL:14
VERSE:If he set his heart upon himself,
VERSE:If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
LABEL:15
VERSE:All flesh shall perish together,
VERSE:And man shall turn again unto dust.
LABEL:16
VERSE:If now thou hast understanding, hear this:
VERSE:Hearken to the voice of my words.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Shall even one that hateth justice govern?
VERSE:And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?â€”
LABEL:18
VERSE:  Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile,
VERSE:Or to nobles, Ye are wicked;
LABEL:19
VERSE:That respecteth not the persons of princes,
VERSE:Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor;
VERSE:For they all are the work of his hands.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In a moment they die, even at midnight;
VERSE:The people are shaken and pass away,
VERSE:And the mighty are taken away without hand.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,
VERSE:And he seeth all his goings.
LABEL:22
VERSE:There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,
VERSE:Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For he needeth not further to consider a man,
VERSE:That he should go before God in judgment.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,
VERSE:And setteth others in their stead.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works;
VERSE:And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He striketh them as wicked men
VERSE:In the open sight of others;
LABEL:27
VERSE:Because they turned aside from following him,
VERSE:And would not have regard in any of his ways:
LABEL:28
VERSE:So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him,
VERSE:And he heard the cry of the afflicted.
LABEL:29
VERSE:When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn?
VERSE:And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?
VERSE:Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man:
LABEL:30
VERSE:That the godless man reign not,
VERSE:That there be none to ensnare the people.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For hath any said unto God,
VERSE:I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
LABEL:32
VERSE:That which I see not teach thou me:
VERSE:If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
LABEL:33
VERSE:Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it?
VERSE:For thou must choose, and not I:
VERSE:Therefore speak what thou knowest.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Men of understanding will say unto me,
VERSE:Yea, every wise man that heareth me:
LABEL:35
VERSE:Job speaketh without knowledge,
VERSE:And his words are without wisdom.
LABEL:36
VERSE:Would that Job were tried unto the end,
VERSE:Because of his answering like wicked men.
LABEL:37
VERSE:For he addeth rebellion unto his sin;
VERSE:He clappeth his hands among us,
VERSE:And multiplieth his words against God.
