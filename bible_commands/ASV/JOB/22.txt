CHAPTER:22
TITLE:Job 22
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Can a man be profitable unto God?
VERSE:Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
VERSE:Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee,
VERSE:That he entereth with thee into judgment?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Is not thy wickedness great?
VERSE:Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought,
VERSE:And stripped the naked of their clothing.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
VERSE:And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;
VERSE:And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou hast sent widows away empty,
VERSE:And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore snares are round about thee,
VERSE:And sudden fear troubleth thee,
LABEL:11
VERSE:Or darkness, so that thou canst not see,
VERSE:And abundance of waters cover thee.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Is not God in the height of heaven?
VERSE:And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
LABEL:13
VERSE:And thou sayest, What doth God know?
VERSE:Can he judge through the thick darkness?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not;
VERSE:And he walketh on the vault of heaven.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Wilt thou keep the old way
VERSE:Which wicked men have trodden?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Who were snatched away before their time,
VERSE:Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Who said unto God, Depart from us;
VERSE:And, What can the Almighty do for us?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Yet he filled their houses with good things:
VERSE:But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The righteous see it, and are glad;
VERSE:And the innocent laugh them to scorn,
LABEL:20
VERSE:  Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off,
VERSE:And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:
VERSE:Thereby good shall come unto thee.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
VERSE:And lay up his words in thy heart.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up,
VERSE:If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And lay thou thy treasure in the dust,
VERSE:And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;
LABEL:25
VERSE:And the Almighty will be thy treasure,
VERSE:And precious silver unto thee.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty,
VERSE:And shalt lift up thy face unto God.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee;
VERSE:And thou shalt pay thy vows.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee;
VERSE:And light shall shine upon thy ways.
LABEL:29
VERSE:When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up;
VERSE:And the humble person he will save.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He will deliver even him that is not innocent:
VERSE:Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.
