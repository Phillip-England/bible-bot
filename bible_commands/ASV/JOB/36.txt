TITLE:Job 36
LABEL:1
VERSE:Elihu also proceeded, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Suffer me a little, and I will show thee;
VERSE:For I have yet somewhat to say on Godâ€™s behalf.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
VERSE:And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For truly my words are not false:
VERSE:One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:
VERSE:He is mighty in strength of understanding.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He preserveth not the life of the wicked,
VERSE:But giveth to the afflicted their right.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
VERSE:But with kings upon the throne
VERSE:He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And if they be bound in fetters,
VERSE:And be taken in the cords of affliction;
LABEL:9
VERSE:Then he showeth them their work,
VERSE:And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He openeth also their ear to instruction,
VERSE:And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If they hearken and serve him,
VERSE:They shall spend their days in prosperity,
VERSE:And their years in pleasures.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword,
VERSE:And they shall die without knowledge.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But they that are godless in heart lay up anger:
VERSE:They cry not for help when he bindeth them.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They die in youth,
VERSE:And their life perisheth among the unclean.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction,
VERSE:And openeth their ear in oppression.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress
VERSE:Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
VERSE:And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked:
VERSE:Judgment and justice take hold on thee.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements;
VERSE:Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress,
VERSE:Or all the forces of thy strength?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Desire not the night,
VERSE:When peoples are cut off in their place.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Take heed, regard not iniquity:
VERSE:For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Behold, God doeth loftily in his power:
VERSE:Who is a teacher like unto him?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Who hath enjoined him his way?
VERSE:Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Remember that thou magnify his work,
VERSE:Whereof men have sung.
LABEL:25
VERSE:All men have looked thereon;
VERSE:Man beholdeth it afar off.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Behold, God is great, and we know him not;
VERSE:The number of his years is unsearchable.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For he draweth up the drops of water,
VERSE:Which distil in rain from his vapor,
LABEL:28
VERSE:Which the skies pour down
VERSE:And drop upon man abundantly.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
VERSE:The thunderings of his pavilion?
LABEL:30
VERSE:Behold, he spreadeth his light around him;
VERSE:And he covereth the bottom of the sea.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For by these he judgeth the peoples;
VERSE:He giveth food in abundance.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He covereth his hands with the lightning,
VERSE:And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
LABEL:33
VERSE:The noise thereof telleth concerning him,
VERSE:The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.
