TITLE:Job 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?
VERSE:But who can withhold himself from speaking?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Behold, thou hast instructed many,
VERSE:And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
VERSE:And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest;
VERSE:It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Is not thy fear of God thy confidence,
VERSE:And the integrity of thy ways thy hope?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?
VERSE:Or where were the upright cut off?
LABEL:8
VERSE:According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
VERSE:And sow trouble, reap the same.
LABEL:9
VERSE:By the breath of God they perish,
VERSE:And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
VERSE:And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
VERSE:And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
VERSE:And mine ear received a whisper thereof.
LABEL:13
VERSE:In thoughts from the visions of the night,
VERSE:When deep sleep falleth on men,
LABEL:14
VERSE:Fear came upon me, and trembling,
VERSE:Which made all my bones to shake.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then a spirit passed before my face;
VERSE:The hair of my flesh stood up.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;
VERSE:A form was before mine eyes:
VERSE:There was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Shall mortal man be more just than God?
VERSE:Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants;
VERSE:And his angels he chargeth with folly:
LABEL:19
VERSE:How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,
VERSE:Whose foundation is in the dust,
VERSE:Who are crushed before the moth!
LABEL:20
VERSE:Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed:
VERSE:They perish for ever without any regarding it.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?
VERSE:They die, and that without wisdom.
