CHAPTER:9
TITLE:Job 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Of a truth I know that it is so:
VERSE:But how can man be just with God?
LABEL:3
VERSE:If he be pleased to contend with him,
VERSE:He cannot answer him one of a thousand.
LABEL:4
VERSE:  He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
VERSE:Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?â€”
LABEL:5
VERSE:  Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not,
VERSE:When he overturneth them in his anger;
LABEL:6
VERSE:That shaketh the earth out of its place,
VERSE:And the pillars thereof tremble;
LABEL:7
VERSE:That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not,
VERSE:And sealeth up the stars;
LABEL:8
VERSE:That alone stretcheth out the heavens,
VERSE:And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;
LABEL:9
VERSE:That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
VERSE:And the chambers of the south;
LABEL:10
VERSE:That doeth great things past finding out,
VERSE:Yea, marvellous things without number.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
VERSE:He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him?
VERSE:Who will say unto him, What doest thou?
LABEL:13
VERSE:God will not withdraw his anger;
VERSE:The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.
LABEL:14
VERSE:How much less shall I answer him,
VERSE:And choose out my words to reason with him?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer;
VERSE:I would make supplication to my judge.
LABEL:16
VERSE:If I had called, and he had answered me,
VERSE:Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For he breaketh me with a tempest,
VERSE:And multiplieth my wounds without cause.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He will not suffer me to take my breath,
VERSE:But filleth me with bitterness.
LABEL:19
VERSE:If we speak of strength, lo, he is mighty!
VERSE:And if of justice, Who, saith he, will summon me?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me:
VERSE:Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.
LABEL:21
VERSE:I am perfect; I regard not myself;
VERSE:I despise my life.
LABEL:22
VERSE:It is all one; therefore I say,
VERSE:He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If the scourge slay suddenly,
VERSE:He will mock at the trial of the innocent.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
VERSE:He covereth the faces of the judges thereof:
VERSE:If it be not he, who then is it?
LABEL:25
VERSE:Now my days are swifter than a post:
VERSE:They flee away, they see no good.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They are passed away as the swift ships;
VERSE:As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.
LABEL:27
VERSE:If I say, I will forget my complaint,
VERSE:I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer;
LABEL:28
VERSE:I am afraid of all my sorrows,
VERSE:I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
LABEL:29
VERSE:I shall be condemned;
VERSE:Why then do I labor in vain?
LABEL:30
VERSE:If I wash myself with snow water,
VERSE:And make my hands never so clean;
LABEL:31
VERSE:Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch,
VERSE:And mine own clothes shall abhor me.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,
VERSE:That we should come together in judgment.
LABEL:33
VERSE:There is no umpire betwixt us,
VERSE:That might lay his hand upon us both.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Let him take his rod away from me,
VERSE:And let not his terror make me afraid:
LABEL:35
VERSE:Then would I speak, and not fear him;
VERSE:For I am not so in myself.
