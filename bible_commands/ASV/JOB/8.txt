TITLE:Job 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:How long wilt thou speak these things?
VERSE:And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Doth God pervert justice?
VERSE:Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?
LABEL:4
VERSE:If thy children have sinned against him,
VERSE:And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;
LABEL:5
VERSE:If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God,
VERSE:And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
LABEL:6
VERSE:If thou wert pure and upright:
VERSE:Surely now he would awake for thee,
VERSE:And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And though thy beginning was small,
VERSE:Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age,
VERSE:And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out
LABEL:9
VERSE:(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
VERSE:Because our days upon earth are a shadow);
LABEL:10
VERSE:Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,
VERSE:And utter words out of their heart?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Can the rush grow up without mire?
VERSE:Can the flag grow without water?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down,
VERSE:It withereth before any other herb.
LABEL:13
VERSE:So are the paths of all that forget God;
VERSE:And the hope of the godless man shall perish:
LABEL:14
VERSE:Whose confidence shall break in sunder,
VERSE:And whose trust is a spiderâ€™s web.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
VERSE:He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He is green before the sun,
VERSE:And his shoots go forth over his garden.
LABEL:17
VERSE:His roots are wrapped about the stone-heap,
VERSE:He beholdeth the place of stones.
LABEL:18
VERSE:If he be destroyed from his place,
VERSE:Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Behold, this is the joy of his way;
VERSE:And out of the earth shall others spring.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
VERSE:Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter,
VERSE:And thy lips with shouting.
LABEL:22
VERSE:They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;
VERSE:And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
