CHAPTER:12
TITLE:Job 12
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:No doubt but ye are the people,
VERSE:And wisdom shall die with you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:But I have understanding as well as you;
VERSE:I am not inferior to you:
VERSE:Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
LABEL:4
VERSE:I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor,
VERSE:I who called upon God, and he answered:
VERSE:The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.
LABEL:5
VERSE:In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune;
VERSE:It is ready for them whose foot slippeth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The tents of robbers prosper,
VERSE:And they that provoke God are secure;
VERSE:Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
VERSE:And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:
LABEL:8
VERSE:Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee;
VERSE:And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Who knoweth not in all these,
VERSE:That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,
LABEL:10
VERSE:In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
VERSE:And the breath of all mankind?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Doth not the ear try words,
VERSE:Even as the palate tasteth its food?
LABEL:12
VERSE:With aged men is wisdom,
VERSE:And in length of days understanding.
LABEL:13
VERSE:With God is wisdom and might;
VERSE:He hath counsel and understanding.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again;
VERSE:He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up;
VERSE:Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:With him is strength and wisdom;
VERSE:The deceived and the deceiver are his.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He leadeth counsellors away stripped,
VERSE:And judges maketh he fools.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He looseth the bond of kings,
VERSE:And he bindeth their loins with a girdle.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He leadeth priests away stripped,
VERSE:And overthroweth the mighty.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He removeth the speech of the trusty,
VERSE:And taketh away the understanding of the elders.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He poureth contempt upon princes,
VERSE:And looseth the belt of the strong.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He uncovereth deep things out of darkness,
VERSE:And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them:
VERSE:He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,
VERSE:And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
LABEL:25
VERSE:They grope in the dark without light;
VERSE:And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
