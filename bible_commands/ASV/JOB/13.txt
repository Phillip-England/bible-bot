CHAPTER:13
TITLE:Job 13
LABEL:1
VERSE:Lo, mine eye hath seen all this,
VERSE:Mine ear hath heard and understood it.
LABEL:2
VERSE:What ye know, the same do I know also:
VERSE:I am not inferior unto you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Surely I would speak to the Almighty,
VERSE:And I desire to reason with God.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But ye are forgers of lies;
VERSE:Ye are all physicians of no value.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace!
VERSE:And it would be your wisdom.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Hear now my reasoning,
VERSE:And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Will ye speak unrighteously for God,
VERSE:And talk deceitfully for him?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Will ye show partiality to him?
VERSE:Will ye contend for God?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Is it good that he should search you out?
VERSE:Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:He will surely reprove you,
VERSE:If ye do secretly show partiality.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Shall not his majesty make you afraid,
VERSE:And his dread fall upon you?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,
VERSE:Your defences are defences of clay.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak;
VERSE:And let come on me what will.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth,
VERSE:And put my life in my hand?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope:
VERSE:Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.
LABEL:16
VERSE:This also shall be my salvation,
VERSE:That a godless man shall not come before him.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Hear diligently my speech,
VERSE:And let my declaration be in your ears.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Behold now, I have set my cause in order;
VERSE:I know that I am righteous.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Who is he that will contend with me?
VERSE:For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Only do not two things unto me;
VERSE:Then will I not hide myself from thy face:
LABEL:21
VERSE:Withdraw thy hand far from me;
VERSE:And let not thy terror make me afraid.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Then call thou, and I will answer;
VERSE:Or let me speak, and answer thou me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:How many are mine iniquities and sins?
VERSE:Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
VERSE:And holdest me for thine enemy?
LABEL:25
VERSE:Wilt thou harass a driven leaf?
VERSE:And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
LABEL:26
VERSE:For thou writest bitter things against me,
VERSE:And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:
LABEL:27
VERSE:Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,
VERSE:And markest all my paths;
VERSE:Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:
LABEL:28
VERSE:Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth,
VERSE:Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
