TITLE:Job 20
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,
VERSE:Even by reason of my haste that is in me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame;
VERSE:And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Knowest thou not this of old time,
VERSE:Since man was placed upon earth,
LABEL:5
VERSE:That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
VERSE:And the joy of the godless but for a moment?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Though his height mount up to the heavens,
VERSE:And his head reach unto the clouds;
LABEL:7
VERSE:Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung:
VERSE:They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?
LABEL:8
VERSE:He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
VERSE:Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The eye which saw him shall see him no more;
VERSE:Neither shall his place any more behold him.
LABEL:10
VERSE:His children shall seek the favor of the poor,
VERSE:And his hands shall give back his wealth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:His bones are full of his youth,
VERSE:But it shall lie down with him in the dust.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
VERSE:Though he hide it under his tongue,
LABEL:13
VERSE:Though he spare it, and will not let it go,
VERSE:But keep it still within his mouth;
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yet his food in his bowels is turned,
VERSE:It is the gall of asps within him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again;
VERSE:God will cast them out of his belly.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He shall suck the poison of asps:
VERSE:The viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He shall not look upon the rivers,
VERSE:The flowing streams of honey and butter.
LABEL:18
VERSE:That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down;
VERSE:According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor;
VERSE:He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Because he knew no quietness within him,
VERSE:He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:There was nothing left that he devoured not;
VERSE:Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
LABEL:22
VERSE:In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
VERSE:The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:When he is about to fill his belly,
VERSE:God will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him,
VERSE:And will rain it upon him while he is eating.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He shall flee from the iron weapon,
VERSE:And the bow of brass shall strike him through.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body;
VERSE:Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall:
VERSE:Terrors are upon him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:All darkness is laid up for his treasures:
VERSE:A fire not blown by man shall devour him;
VERSE:It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
LABEL:27
VERSE:The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,
VERSE:And the earth shall rise up against him.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The increase of his house shall depart;
VERSE:His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
LABEL:29
VERSE:This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
VERSE:And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
