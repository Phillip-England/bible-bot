CHAPTER:30
TITLE:Job 30
LABEL:1
VERSE:But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
VERSE:Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me?
VERSE:Men in whom ripe age is perished.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They are gaunt with want and famine;
VERSE:They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They pluck salt-wort by the bushes;
VERSE:And the roots of the broom are their food.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They are driven forth from the midst of men;
VERSE:They cry after them as after a thief;
LABEL:6
VERSE:So that they dwell in frightful valleys,
VERSE:In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Among the bushes they bray;
VERSE:Under the nettles they are gathered together.
LABEL:8
VERSE:  They are children of fools, yea, children of base men;
VERSE:They were scourged out of the land.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And now I am become their song,
VERSE:Yea, I am a byword unto them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,
VERSE:And spare not to spit in my face.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me;
VERSE:And they have cast off the bridle before me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Upon my right hand rise the rabble;
VERSE:They thrust aside my feet,
VERSE:And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They mar my path,
VERSE:They set forward my calamity,
VERSE:Even men that have no helper.
LABEL:14
VERSE:As through a wide breach they come:
VERSE:In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Terrors are turned upon me;
VERSE:They chase mine honor as the wind;
VERSE:And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And now my soul is poured out within me;
VERSE:Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:In the night season my bones are pierced in me,
VERSE:And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.
LABEL:18
VERSE:By Godâ€™s great force is my garment disfigured;
VERSE:It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He hath cast me into the mire,
VERSE:And I am become like dust and ashes.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me:
VERSE:I stand up, and thou gazest at me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Thou art turned to be cruel to me;
VERSE:With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it;
VERSE:And thou dissolvest me in the storm.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
VERSE:And to the house appointed for all living.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall?
VERSE:Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
LABEL:25
VERSE:Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
VERSE:Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
LABEL:26
VERSE:When I looked for good, then evil came;
VERSE:And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
LABEL:27
VERSE:My heart is troubled, and resteth not;
VERSE:Days of affliction are come upon me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:I go mourning without the sun:
VERSE:I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
LABEL:29
VERSE:I am a brother to jackals,
VERSE:And a companion to ostriches.
LABEL:30
VERSE:My skin is black, and falleth from me,
VERSE:And my bones are burned with heat.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Therefore is my harp turned to mourning,
VERSE:And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.
