TITLE:Job 11
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Should not the multitude of words be answered?
VERSE:And should a man full of talk be justified?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Should thy boastings make men hold their peace?
VERSE:And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure,
VERSE:And I am clean in thine eyes.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But oh that God would speak,
VERSE:And open his lips against thee,
LABEL:6
VERSE:And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom!
VERSE:For he is manifold in understanding.
VERSE:Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Canst thou by searching find out God?
VERSE:Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
LABEL:8
VERSE:It is high as heaven; what canst thou do?
VERSE:Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?
LABEL:9
VERSE:The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
VERSE:And broader than the sea.
LABEL:10
VERSE:If he pass through, and shut up,
VERSE:And call unto judgment, then who can hinder him?
LABEL:11
VERSE:For he knoweth false men:
VERSE:He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But vain man is void of understanding,
VERSE:Yea, man is born as a wild assâ€™s colt.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If thou set thy heart aright,
VERSE:And stretch out thy hands toward him;
LABEL:14
VERSE:If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away,
VERSE:And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
VERSE:Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
LABEL:16
VERSE:For thou shalt forget thy misery;
VERSE:Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,
LABEL:17
VERSE:And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday;
VERSE:Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;
VERSE:Yea, thou shalt search about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
VERSE:Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
LABEL:20
VERSE:But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
VERSE:And they shall have no way to flee;
VERSE:And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.
