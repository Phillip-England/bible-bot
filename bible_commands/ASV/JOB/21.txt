CHAPTER:21
TITLE:Job 21
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear diligently my speech;
VERSE:And let this be your consolations.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Suffer me, and I also will speak;
VERSE:And after that I have spoken, mock on.
LABEL:4
VERSE:As for me, is my complaint to man?
VERSE:And why should I not be impatient?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Mark me, and be astonished,
VERSE:And lay your hand upon your mouth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Even when I remember I am troubled,
VERSE:And horror taketh hold on my flesh.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wherefore do the wicked live,
VERSE:Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Their seed is established with them in their sight,
VERSE:And their offspring before their eyes.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Their houses are safe from fear,
VERSE:Neither is the rod of God upon them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
VERSE:Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They send forth their little ones like a flock,
VERSE:And their children dance.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They sing to the timbrel and harp,
VERSE:And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They spend their days in prosperity,
VERSE:And in a moment they go down to Sheol.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And they say unto God, Depart from us;
VERSE:For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
LABEL:15
VERSE:What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
VERSE:And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand:
VERSE:The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?
VERSE:That their calamity cometh upon them?
VERSE:That God distributeth sorrows in his anger?
LABEL:18
VERSE:That they are as stubble before the wind,
VERSE:And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?
LABEL:19
VERSE:  Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children.
VERSE:Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:
LABEL:20
VERSE:Let his own eyes see his destruction,
VERSE:And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For what careth he for his house after him,
VERSE:When the number of his months is cut off?
LABEL:22
VERSE:Shall any teach God knowledge,
VERSE:Seeing he judgeth those that are high?
LABEL:23
VERSE:One dieth in his full strength,
VERSE:Being wholly at ease and quiet:
LABEL:24
VERSE:His pails are full of milk,
VERSE:And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
LABEL:25
VERSE:And another dieth in bitterness of soul,
VERSE:And never tasteth of good.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They lie down alike in the dust,
VERSE:And the worm covereth them.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Behold, I know your thoughts,
VERSE:And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?
VERSE:And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?
LABEL:29
VERSE:Have ye not asked wayfaring men?
VERSE:And do ye not know their evidences,
LABEL:30
VERSE:That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?
VERSE:That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
LABEL:31
VERSE:Who shall declare his way to his face?
VERSE:And who shall repay him what he hath done?
LABEL:32
VERSE:Yet shall he be borne to the grave,
VERSE:And men shall keep watch over the tomb.
LABEL:33
VERSE:The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
VERSE:And all men shall draw after him,
VERSE:As there were innumerable before him.
LABEL:34
VERSE:How then comfort ye me in vain,
VERSE:Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?
