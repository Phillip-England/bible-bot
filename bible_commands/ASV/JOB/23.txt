TITLE:Job 23
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Even to-day is my complaint rebellious:
VERSE:My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Oh that I knew where I might find him!
VERSE:That I might come even to his seat!
LABEL:4
VERSE:I would set my cause in order before him,
VERSE:And fill my mouth with arguments.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I would know the words which he would answer me,
VERSE:And understand what he would say unto me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
VERSE:Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:There the upright might reason with him;
VERSE:So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Behold, I go forward, but he is not there;
VERSE:And backward, but I cannot perceive him;
LABEL:9
VERSE:On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him;
VERSE:He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But he knoweth the way that I take;
VERSE:When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My foot hath held fast to his steps;
VERSE:His way have I kept, and turned not aside.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips;
VERSE:I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?
VERSE:And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For he performeth that which is appointed for me:
VERSE:And many such things are with him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore am I terrified at his presence;
VERSE:When I consider, I am afraid of him.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For God hath made my heart faint,
VERSE:And the Almighty hath terrified me;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Because I was not cut off before the darkness,
VERSE:Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
