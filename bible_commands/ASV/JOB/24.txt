CHAPTER:24
TITLE:Job 24
LABEL:1
VERSE:Why are times not laid up by the Almighty?
VERSE:And why do not they that know him see his days?
LABEL:2
VERSE:There are that remove the landmarks;
VERSE:They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They drive away the ass of the fatherless;
VERSE:They take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They turn the needy out of the way:
VERSE:The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, as wild asses in the desert
VERSE:They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food;
VERSE:The wilderness yieldeth them bread for their children.
LABEL:6
VERSE:They cut their provender in the field;
VERSE:And they glean the vintage of the wicked.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They lie all night naked without clothing,
VERSE:And have no covering in the cold.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
VERSE:And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
LABEL:9
VERSE:There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast,
VERSE:And take a pledge of the poor;
LABEL:10
VERSE:  So that they go about naked without clothing,
VERSE:And being hungry they carry the sheaves.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They make oil within the walls of these men;
VERSE:They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
LABEL:12
VERSE:From out of the populous city men groan,
VERSE:And the soul of the wounded crieth out:
VERSE:Yet God regardeth not the folly.
LABEL:13
VERSE:These are of them that rebel against the light;
VERSE:They know not the ways thereof,
VERSE:Nor abide in the paths thereof.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The murderer riseth with the light;
VERSE:He killeth the poor and needy;
VERSE:And in the night he is as a thief.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
VERSE:Saying, No eye shall see me:
VERSE:And he disguiseth his face.
LABEL:16
VERSE:In the dark they dig through houses:
VERSE:They shut themselves up in the day-time;
VERSE:They know not the light.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness;
VERSE:For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters;
VERSE:Their portion is cursed in the earth:
VERSE:They turn not into the way of the vineyards.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
VERSE:So doth Sheol those that have sinned.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The womb shall forget him;
VERSE:The worm shall feed sweetly on him;
VERSE:He shall be no more remembered;
VERSE:And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He devoureth the barren that beareth not,
VERSE:And doeth not good to the widow.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yet God preserveth the mighty by his power:
VERSE:He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.
LABEL:23
VERSE:  God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon;
VERSE:And his eyes are upon their ways.
LABEL:24
VERSE:They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone;
VERSE:Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,
VERSE:And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
LABEL:25
VERSE:And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar,
VERSE:And make my speech nothing worth?
