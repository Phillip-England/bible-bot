CHAPTER:16
TITLE:Job 16
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:I have heard many such things:
VERSE:Miserable comforters are ye all.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Shall vain words have an end?
VERSE:Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
LABEL:4
VERSE:I also could speak as ye do;
VERSE:If your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead,
VERSE:I could join words together against you,
VERSE:And shake my head at you.
LABEL:5
VERSE:  But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
VERSE:And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged;
VERSE:And though I forbear, what am I eased?
LABEL:7
VERSE:But now he hath made me weary:
VERSE:Thou hast made desolate all my company.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me:
VERSE:And my leanness riseth up against me,
VERSE:It testifieth to my face.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me;
VERSE:He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth:
VERSE:Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
VERSE:They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully:
VERSE:They gather themselves together against me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:God delivereth me to the ungodly,
VERSE:And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;
VERSE:Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:
VERSE:He hath also set me up for his mark.
LABEL:13
VERSE:His archers compass me round about;
VERSE:He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
VERSE:He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He breaketh me with breach upon breach;
VERSE:He runneth upon me like a giant.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
VERSE:And have laid my horn in the dust.
LABEL:16
VERSE:My face is red with weeping,
VERSE:And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Although there is no violence in my hands,
VERSE:And my prayer is pure.
LABEL:18
VERSE:O earth, cover not thou my blood,
VERSE:And let my cry have no resting-place.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
VERSE:And he that voucheth for me is on high.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My friends scoff at me:
VERSE:But mine eye poureth out tears unto God,
LABEL:21
VERSE:That he would maintain the right of a man with God,
VERSE:And of a son of man with his neighbor!
LABEL:22
VERSE:For when a few years are come,
VERSE:I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
