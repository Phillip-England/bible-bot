CHAPTER:39
TITLE:Job 39
LABEL:1
VERSE:Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
VERSE:Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?
VERSE:Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
LABEL:3
VERSE:They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,
VERSE:They cast out their pains.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field;
VERSE:They go forth, and return not again.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
VERSE:Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
LABEL:6
VERSE:Whose home I have made the wilderness,
VERSE:And the salt land his dwelling-place?
LABEL:7
VERSE:He scorneth the tumult of the city,
VERSE:Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The range of the mountains is his pasture,
VERSE:And he searcheth after every green thing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee?
VERSE:Or will he abide by thy crib?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow?
VERSE:Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?
VERSE:Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed,
VERSE:And gather the grain of thy threshing-floor?
LABEL:13
VERSE:The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
VERSE:But are they the pinions and plumage of love?
LABEL:14
VERSE:For she leaveth her eggs on the earth,
VERSE:And warmeth them in the dust,
LABEL:15
VERSE:And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
VERSE:Or that the wild beast may trample them.
LABEL:16
VERSE:She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers:
VERSE:Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
VERSE:Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
LABEL:18
VERSE:What time she lifteth up herself on high,
VERSE:She scorneth the horse and his rider.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Hast thou given the horse his might?
VERSE:Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Hast thou made him to leap as a locust?
VERSE:The glory of his snorting is terrible.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
VERSE:He goeth out to meet the armed men.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed;
VERSE:Neither turneth he back from the sword.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The quiver rattleth against him,
VERSE:The flashing spear and the javelin.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage;
VERSE:Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.
LABEL:25
VERSE:As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha!
VERSE:And he smelleth the battle afar off,
VERSE:The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth,
VERSE:And stretcheth her wings toward the south?
LABEL:27
VERSE:Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up,
VERSE:And maketh her nest on high?
LABEL:28
VERSE:On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home,
VERSE:Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.
LABEL:29
VERSE:From thence she spieth out the prey;
VERSE:Her eyes behold it afar off.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Her young ones also suck up blood:
VERSE:And where the slain are, there is she.
