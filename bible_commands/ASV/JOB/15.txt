CHAPTER:15
TITLE:Job 15
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge,
VERSE:And fill himself with the east wind?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
VERSE:Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Yea, thou doest away with fear,
VERSE:And hinderest devotion before God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth,
VERSE:And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I;
VERSE:Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Art thou the first man that was born?
VERSE:Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God?
VERSE:And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?
LABEL:9
VERSE:What knowest thou, that we know not?
VERSE:What understandest thou, which is not in us?
LABEL:10
VERSE:With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,
VERSE:Much elder than thy father.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Are the consolations of God too small for thee,
VERSE:Even the word that is gentle toward thee?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why doth thy heart carry thee away?
VERSE:And why do thine eyes flash,
LABEL:13
VERSE:That against God thou turnest thy spirit,
VERSE:And lettest words go out of thy mouth?
LABEL:14
VERSE:What is man, that he should be clean?
VERSE:And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones;
VERSE:Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:
LABEL:16
VERSE:How much less one that is abominable and corrupt,
VERSE:A man that drinketh iniquity like water!
LABEL:17
VERSE:I will show thee, hear thou me;
VERSE:And that which I have seen I will declare
LABEL:18
VERSE:(Which wise men have told
VERSE:From their fathers, and have not hid it;
LABEL:19
VERSE:Unto whom alone the land was given,
VERSE:And no stranger passed among them):
LABEL:20
VERSE:The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,
VERSE:Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
LABEL:21
VERSE:A sound of terrors is in his ears;
VERSE:In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,
VERSE:And he is waited for of the sword.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?
VERSE:He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Distress and anguish make him afraid;
VERSE:They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Because he hath stretched out his hand against God,
VERSE:And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;
LABEL:26
VERSE:He runneth upon him with a stiff neck,
VERSE:With the thick bosses of his bucklers;
LABEL:27
VERSE:Because he hath covered his face with his fatness,
VERSE:And gathered fat upon his loins;
LABEL:28
VERSE:And he hath dwelt in desolate cities,
VERSE:In houses which no man inhabited,
VERSE:Which were ready to become heaps;
LABEL:29
VERSE:He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
VERSE:Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He shall not depart out of darkness;
VERSE:The flame shall dry up his branches,
VERSE:And by the breath of Godâ€™s mouth shall he go away.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself;
VERSE:For vanity shall be his recompense.
LABEL:32
VERSE:It shall be accomplished before his time,
VERSE:And his branch shall not be green.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
VERSE:And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.
LABEL:34
VERSE:For the company of the godless shall be barren,
VERSE:And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
LABEL:35
VERSE:They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity,
VERSE:And their heart prepareth deceit.
