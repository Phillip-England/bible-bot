CHAPTER:14
TITLE:Job 14
LABEL:1
VERSE:Man, that is born of a woman,
VERSE:Is of few days, and full of trouble.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
VERSE:He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one,
VERSE:And bringest me into judgment with thee?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Seeing his days are determined,
VERSE:The number of his months is with thee,
VERSE:And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
LABEL:6
VERSE:Look away from him, that he may rest,
VERSE:Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For there is hope of a tree,
VERSE:If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
VERSE:And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
VERSE:And the stock thereof die in the ground;
LABEL:9
VERSE:Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
VERSE:And put forth boughs like a plant.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But man dieth, and is laid low:
VERSE:Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
LABEL:11
VERSE:  As the waters fail from the sea,
VERSE:And the river wasteth and drieth up;
LABEL:12
VERSE:So man lieth down and riseth not:
VERSE:Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
VERSE:Nor be roused out of their sleep.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol,
VERSE:That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,
VERSE:That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
LABEL:14
VERSE:If a man die, shall he live again?
VERSE:All the days of my warfare would I wait,
VERSE:Till my release should come.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee:
VERSE:Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But now thou numberest my steps:
VERSE:Dost thou not watch over my sin?
LABEL:17
VERSE:My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
VERSE:And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But the mountain falling cometh to nought;
VERSE:And the rock is removed out of its place;
LABEL:19
VERSE:The waters wear the stones;
VERSE:The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth:
VERSE:So thou destroyest the hope of man.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth;
VERSE:Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not;
VERSE:And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But his flesh upon him hath pain,
VERSE:And his soul within him mourneth.
