CHAPTER:17
TITLE:Job 17
LABEL:1
VERSE:My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct,
VERSE:The grave is ready for me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Surely there are mockers with me,
VERSE:And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself;
VERSE:Who is there that will strike hands with me?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
VERSE:Therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:He that denounceth his friends for a prey,
VERSE:Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
LABEL:6
VERSE:But he hath made me a byword of the people;
VERSE:And they spit in my face.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
VERSE:And all my members are as a shadow.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Upright men shall be astonished at this,
VERSE:And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Yet shall the righteous hold on his way,
VERSE:And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But as for you all, come on now again;
VERSE:And I shall not find a wise man among you.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
VERSE:Even the thoughts of my heart.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They change the night into day:
VERSE:The light, say they, is near unto the darkness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If I look for Sheol as my house;
VERSE:If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
LABEL:14
VERSE:If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father;
VERSE:To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;
LABEL:15
VERSE:Where then is my hope?
VERSE:And as for my hope, who shall see it?
LABEL:16
VERSE:It shall go down to the bars of Sheol,
VERSE:When once there is rest in the dust.
