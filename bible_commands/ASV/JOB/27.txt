CHAPTER:27
TITLE:Job 27
LABEL:1
VERSE:And Job again took up his parable, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:As God liveth, who hath taken away my right,
VERSE:And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul
LABEL:3
VERSE:(For my life is yet whole in me,
VERSE:And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);
LABEL:4
VERSE:Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,
VERSE:Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Far be it from me that I should justify you:
VERSE:Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:
VERSE:My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
VERSE:And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain,
VERSE:When God taketh away his soul?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Will God hear his cry,
VERSE:When trouble cometh upon him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Will he delight himself in the Almighty,
VERSE:And call upon God at all times?
LABEL:11
VERSE:I will teach you concerning the hand of God;
VERSE:That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
VERSE:Why then are ye become altogether vain?
LABEL:13
VERSE:This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
VERSE:And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:
LABEL:14
VERSE:If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword;
VERSE:And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Those that remain of him shall be buried in death,
VERSE:And his widows shall make no lamentation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Though he heap up silver as the dust,
VERSE:And prepare raiment as the clay;
LABEL:17
VERSE:He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,
VERSE:And the innocent shall divide the silver.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He buildeth his house as the moth,
VERSE:And as a booth which the keeper maketh.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered to his fathers;
VERSE:He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Terrors overtake him like waters;
VERSE:A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth;
VERSE:And it sweepeth him out of his place.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For God shall hurl at him, and not spare:
VERSE:He would fain flee out of his hand.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Men shall clap their hands at him,
VERSE:And shall hiss him out of his place.
