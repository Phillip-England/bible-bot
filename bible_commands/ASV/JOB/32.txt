CHAPTER:32
TITLE:Job 32
LABEL:1
VERSE:So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,
VERSE:I am young, and ye are very old;
VERSE:Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I said, Days should speak,
VERSE:And multitude of years should teach wisdom.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But there is a spirit in man,
VERSE:And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
LABEL:9
VERSE:It is not the great that are wise,
VERSE:Nor the aged that understand justice.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore I said, Hearken to me;
VERSE:I also will show mine opinion.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, I waited for your words,
VERSE:I listened for your reasonings,
VERSE:Whilst ye searched out what to say.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Yea, I attended unto you,
VERSE:And, behold, there was none that convinced Job,
VERSE:Or that answered his words, among you.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom;
VERSE:God may vanquish him, not man:
LABEL:14
VERSE:For he hath not directed his words against me;
VERSE:Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
LABEL:15
VERSE:They are amazed, they answer no more:
VERSE:They have not a word to say.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And shall I wait, because they speak not,
VERSE:Because they stand still, and answer no more?
LABEL:17
VERSE:I also will answer my part,
VERSE:I also will show mine opinion.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For I am full of words;
VERSE:The spirit within me constraineth me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent;
VERSE:Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I will speak, that I may be refreshed;
VERSE:I will open my lips and answer.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Let me not, I pray you, respect any manâ€™s person;
VERSE:Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For I know not to give flattering titles;
VERSE:Else would my Maker soon take me away.
