VERSE:Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:How long will ye hunt for words?
VERSE:Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
VERSE:And are become unclean in your sight?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger,
VERSE:Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
VERSE:Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
VERSE:And the spark of his fire shall not shine.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The light shall be dark in his tent,
VERSE:And his lamp above him shall be put out.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
VERSE:And his own counsel shall cast him down.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
VERSE:And he walketh upon the toils.
LABEL:9
VERSE:A gin shall take him by the heel,
VERSE:And a snare shall lay hold on him.
LABEL:10
VERSE:A noose is hid for him in the ground,
VERSE:And a trap for him in the way.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
VERSE:And shall chase him at his heels.
LABEL:12
VERSE:His strength shall be hunger-bitten,
VERSE:And calamity shall be ready at his side.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The members of his body shall be devoured,
VERSE:Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth;
VERSE:And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
LABEL:15
VERSE:There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his:
VERSE:Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:His roots shall be dried up beneath,
VERSE:And above shall his branch be cut off.
LABEL:17
VERSE:His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
VERSE:And he shall have no name in the street.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He shall be driven from light into darkness,
VERSE:And chased out of the world.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He shall have neither son nor sonâ€™s son among his people,
VERSE:Nor any remaining where he sojourned.
LABEL:20
VERSE:They that come after shall be astonished at his day,
VERSE:As they that went before were affrighted.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous,
VERSE:And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
