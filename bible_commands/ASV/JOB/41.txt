CHAPTER:41
TITLE:Job 41
LABEL:1
VERSE:Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook?
VERSE:Or press down his tongue with a cord?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Canst thou put a rope into his nose?
VERSE:Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Will he make many supplications unto thee?
VERSE:Or will he speak soft words unto thee?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Will he make a covenant with thee,
VERSE:That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
VERSE:Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Will the bands of fishermen make traffic of him?
VERSE:Will they part him among the merchants?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons,
VERSE:Or his head with fish-spears?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Lay thy hand upon him;
VERSE:Remember the battle, and do so no more.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
VERSE:Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:None is so fierce that he dare stir him up;
VERSE:Who then is he that can stand before me?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?
VERSE:Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
VERSE:Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who can strip off his outer garment?
VERSE:Who shall come within his jaws?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Who can open the doors of his face?
VERSE:Round about his teeth is terror.
LABEL:15
VERSE:  His strong scales are his pride,
VERSE:Shut up together as with a close seal.
LABEL:16
VERSE:One is so near to another,
VERSE:That no air can come between them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They are joined one to another;
VERSE:They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.
LABEL:18
VERSE:His sneezings flash forth light,
VERSE:And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Out of his mouth go burning torches,
VERSE:And sparks of fire leap forth.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth,
VERSE:As of a boiling pot and burning rushes.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His breath kindleth coals,
VERSE:And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.
LABEL:22
VERSE:In his neck abideth strength,
VERSE:And terror danceth before him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The flakes of his flesh are joined together:
VERSE:They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
LABEL:24
VERSE:His heart is as firm as a stone;
VERSE:Yea, firm as the nether millstone.
LABEL:25
VERSE:When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid:
VERSE:By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.
LABEL:26
VERSE:If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail;
VERSE:Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He counteth iron as straw,
VERSE:And brass as rotten wood.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The arrow cannot make him flee:
VERSE:Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Clubs are counted as stubble:
VERSE:He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.
LABEL:30
VERSE:His underparts are like sharp potsherds:
VERSE:He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire.
LABEL:31
VERSE:He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
VERSE:He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He maketh a path to shine after him;
VERSE:One would think the deep to be hoary.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Upon earth there is not his like,
VERSE:That is made without fear.
LABEL:34
VERSE:He beholdeth everything that is high:
VERSE:He is king over all the sons of pride.
