TITLE:Job 40
LABEL:1
VERSE:Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty?
VERSE:He that argueth with God, let him answer it.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,
LABEL:4
VERSE:Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee?
VERSE:I lay my hand upon my mouth.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Once have I spoken, and I will not answer;
VERSE:Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
LABEL:7
VERSE:Gird up thy loins now like a man:
VERSE:I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Wilt thou even annul my judgment?
VERSE:Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Or hast thou an arm like God?
VERSE:And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity;
VERSE:And array thyself with honor and majesty.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger;
VERSE:And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
VERSE:And tread down the wicked where they stand.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Hide them in the dust together;
VERSE:Bind their faces in the hidden place.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Then will I also confess of thee
VERSE:That thine own right hand can save thee.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee;
VERSE:He eateth grass as an ox.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
VERSE:And his force is in the muscles of his belly.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He moveth his tail like a cedar:
VERSE:The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
LABEL:18
VERSE:His bones are as tubes of brass;
VERSE:His limbs are like bars of iron.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He is the chief of the ways of God:
VERSE:He only that made him giveth him his sword.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
VERSE:Where all the beasts of the field do play.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He lieth under the lotus-trees,
VERSE:In the covert of the reed, and the fen.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The lotus-trees cover him with their shade;
VERSE:The willows of the brook compass him about.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;
VERSE:He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Shall any take him when he is on the watch,
VERSE:Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
