CHAPTER:35
TITLE:Job 35
LABEL:1
VERSE:Moreover Elihu answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thinkest thou this to be thy right,
VERSE:Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than Godâ€™s,
LABEL:3
VERSE:That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee?
VERSE:And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will answer thee,
VERSE:And thy companions with thee.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Look unto the heavens, and see;
VERSE:And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
LABEL:6
VERSE:If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him?
VERSE:And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
LABEL:7
VERSE:If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?
VERSE:Or what receiveth he of thy hand?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art;
VERSE:And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.
LABEL:9
VERSE:By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;
VERSE:They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But none saith, Where is God my Maker,
VERSE:Who giveth songs in the night,
LABEL:11
VERSE:Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
VERSE:And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
LABEL:12
VERSE:There they cry, but none giveth answer,
VERSE:Because of the pride of evil men.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Surely God will not hear an empty cry,
VERSE:Neither will the Almighty regard it.
LABEL:14
VERSE:How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not,
VERSE:The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!
LABEL:15
VERSE:But now, because he hath not visited in his anger,
VERSE:Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;
LABEL:16
VERSE:Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity;
VERSE:He multiplieth words without knowledge.
