CHAPTER:19
TITLE:Job 19
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:How long will ye vex my soul,
VERSE:And break me in pieces with words?
LABEL:3
VERSE:These ten times have ye reproached me:
VERSE:Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And be it indeed that I have erred,
VERSE:Mine error remaineth with myself.
LABEL:5
VERSE:If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
VERSE:And plead against me my reproach;
LABEL:6
VERSE:Know now that God hath subverted me in my cause,
VERSE:And hath compassed me with his net.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
VERSE:I cry for help, but there is no justice.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass,
VERSE:And hath set darkness in my paths.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He hath stripped me of my glory,
VERSE:And taken the crown from my head.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone;
VERSE:And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
VERSE:And he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries.
LABEL:12
VERSE:His troops come on together,
VERSE:And cast up their way against me,
VERSE:And encamp round about my tent.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He hath put my brethren far from me,
VERSE:And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.
LABEL:14
VERSE:My kinsfolk have failed,
VERSE:And my familiar friends have forgotten me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger:
VERSE:I am an alien in their sight.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer,
VERSE:Though I entreat him with my mouth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:My breath is strange to my wife,
VERSE:And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Even young children despise me;
VERSE:If I arise, they speak against me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:All my familiar friends abhor me,
VERSE:And they whom I loved are turned against me.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
VERSE:And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
VERSE:For the hand of God hath touched me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Why do ye persecute me as God,
VERSE:And are not satisfied with my flesh?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Oh that my words were now written!
VERSE:Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
LABEL:24
VERSE:That with an iron pen and lead
VERSE:They were graven in the rock for ever!
LABEL:25
VERSE:But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth,
VERSE:And at last he will stand up upon the earth:
LABEL:26
VERSE:And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed,
VERSE:Then without my flesh shall I see God;
LABEL:27
VERSE:Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side,
VERSE:And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.
VERSE:My heart is consumed within me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:If ye say, How we will persecute him!
VERSE:And that the root of the matter is found in me;
LABEL:29
VERSE:Be ye afraid of the sword:
VERSE:For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword,
VERSE:That ye may know there is a judgment.
