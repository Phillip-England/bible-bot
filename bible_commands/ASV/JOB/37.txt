TITLE:Job 37
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yea, at this my heart trembleth,
VERSE:And is moved out of its place.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,
VERSE:And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,
VERSE:And his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
LABEL:4
VERSE:After it a voice roareth;
VERSE:He thundereth with the voice of his majesty;
VERSE:And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard.
LABEL:5
VERSE:God thundereth marvellously with his voice;
VERSE:Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth;
VERSE:Likewise to the shower of rain,
VERSE:And to the showers of his mighty rain.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He sealeth up the hand of every man,
VERSE:That all men whom he hath made may know it.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Then the beasts go into coverts,
VERSE:And remain in their dens.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm,
VERSE:And cold out of the north.
LABEL:10
VERSE:By the breath of God ice is given;
VERSE:And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture;
VERSE:He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:
LABEL:12
VERSE:And it is turned round about by his guidance,
VERSE:That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them
VERSE:Upon the face of the habitable world,
LABEL:13
VERSE:Whether it be for correction, or for his land,
VERSE:Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Hearken unto this, O Job:
VERSE:Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them,
VERSE:And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
VERSE:The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
LABEL:17
VERSE:How thy garments are warm,
VERSE:When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Canst thou with him spread out the sky,
VERSE:Which is strong as a molten mirror?
LABEL:19
VERSE:Teach us what we shall say unto him;
VERSE:For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Shall it be told him that I would speak?
VERSE:Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
LABEL:21
VERSE:And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies;
VERSE:But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Out of the north cometh golden splendor:
VERSE:God hath upon him terrible majesty.
LABEL:23
VERSE:  Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
VERSE:He is excellent in power;
VERSE:And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Men do therefore fear him:
VERSE:He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
