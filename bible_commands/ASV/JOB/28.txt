CHAPTER:28
TITLE:Job 28
LABEL:1
VERSE:Surely there is a mine for silver,
VERSE:And a place for gold which they refine.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Iron is taken out of the earth,
VERSE:And copper is molten out of the stone.
LABEL:3
VERSE:  Man setteth an end to darkness,
VERSE:And searcheth out, to the furthest bound,
VERSE:The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn;
VERSE:They are forgotten of the foot;
VERSE:They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.
LABEL:5
VERSE:As for the earth, out of it cometh bread;
VERSE:And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,
VERSE:And it hath dust of gold.
LABEL:7
VERSE:That path no bird of prey knoweth,
VERSE:Neither hath the falconâ€™s eye seen it:
LABEL:8
VERSE:The proud beasts have not trodden it,
VERSE:Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock;
VERSE:He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He cutteth out channels among the rocks;
VERSE:And his eye seeth every precious thing.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He bindeth the streams that they trickle not;
VERSE:And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But where shall wisdom be found?
VERSE:And where is the place of understanding?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Man knoweth not the price thereof;
VERSE:Neither is it found in the land of the living.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The deep saith, It is not in me;
VERSE:And the sea saith, It is not with me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:It cannot be gotten for gold,
VERSE:Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
VERSE:With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Gold and glass cannot equal it,
VERSE:Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
LABEL:18
VERSE:No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal:
VERSE:Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
VERSE:Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Whence then cometh wisdom?
VERSE:And where is the place of understanding?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
VERSE:And kept close from the birds of the heavens.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Destruction and Death say,
VERSE:We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.
LABEL:23
VERSE:God understandeth the way thereof,
VERSE:And he knoweth the place thereof.
LABEL:24
VERSE:For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
VERSE:And seeth under the whole heaven;
LABEL:25
VERSE:To make a weight for the wind:
VERSE:Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.
LABEL:26
VERSE:When he made a decree for the rain,
VERSE:And a way for the lightning of the thunder;
LABEL:27
VERSE:Then did he see it, and declare it;
VERSE:He established it, yea, and searched it out.
LABEL:28
VERSE:And unto man he said,
VERSE:Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
VERSE:And to depart from evil is understanding.
