CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Job 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:Is there not a warfare to man upon earth?
VERSE:And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
LABEL:2
VERSE:As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow,
VERSE:And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:
LABEL:3
VERSE:So am I made to possess months of misery,
VERSE:And wearisome nights are appointed to me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:When I lie down, I say,
VERSE:When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
VERSE:And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
LABEL:5
VERSE:My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
VERSE:My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.
LABEL:6
VERSE:My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle,
VERSE:And are spent without hope.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Oh remember that my life is a breath:
VERSE:Mine eye shall no more see good.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more;
VERSE:Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.
LABEL:9
VERSE:As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,
VERSE:So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He shall return no more to his house,
VERSE:Neither shall his place know him any more.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
VERSE:I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
VERSE:I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,
VERSE:That thou settest a watch over me?
LABEL:13
VERSE:When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
VERSE:My couch shall ease my complaint;
LABEL:14
VERSE:Then thou scarest me with dreams,
VERSE:And terrifiest me through visions:
LABEL:15
VERSE:So that my soul chooseth strangling,
VERSE:And death rather than these my bones.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I loathe my life; I would not live alway:
VERSE:Let me alone; for my days are vanity.
LABEL:17
VERSE:What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him,
VERSE:And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,
LABEL:18
VERSE:And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,
VERSE:And try him every moment?
LABEL:19
VERSE:How long wilt thou not look away from me,
VERSE:Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
LABEL:20
VERSE:If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men?
VERSE:Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee,
VERSE:So that I am a burden to myself?
LABEL:21
VERSE:And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?
VERSE:For now shall I lie down in the dust;
VERSE:And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.
