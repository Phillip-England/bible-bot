CHAPTER:31
TITLE:Job 31
LABEL:1
VERSE:I made a covenant with mine eyes;
VERSE:How then should I look upon a virgin?
LABEL:2
VERSE:For what is the portion from God above,
VERSE:And the heritage from the Almighty on high?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
VERSE:And disaster to the workers of iniquity?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Doth not he see my ways,
VERSE:And number all my steps?
LABEL:5
VERSE:If I have walked with falsehood,
VERSE:And my foot hath hasted to deceit
LABEL:6
VERSE:(Let me be weighed in an even balance,
VERSE:That God may know mine integrity);
LABEL:7
VERSE:If my step hath turned out of the way,
VERSE:And my heart walked after mine eyes,
VERSE:And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:
LABEL:8
VERSE:Then let me sow, and let another eat;
VERSE:Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.
LABEL:9
VERSE:If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman,
VERSE:And I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;
LABEL:10
VERSE:Then let my wife grind unto another,
VERSE:And let others bow down upon her.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For that were a heinous crime;
VERSE:Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:
LABEL:12
VERSE:For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction,
VERSE:And would root out all mine increase.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant,
VERSE:When they contended with me;
LABEL:14
VERSE:What then shall I do when God riseth up?
VERSE:And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Did not he that made me in the womb make him?
VERSE:And did not one fashion us in the womb?
LABEL:16
VERSE:If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
VERSE:Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Or have eaten my morsel alone,
VERSE:And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
LABEL:18
VERSE:(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
VERSE:And her have I guided from my mother’s womb);
LABEL:19
VERSE:If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
VERSE:Or that the needy had no covering;
LABEL:20
VERSE:If his loins have not blessed me,
VERSE:And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
LABEL:21
VERSE:If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
VERSE:Because I saw my help in the gate:
LABEL:22
VERSE:Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade,
VERSE:And mine arm be broken from the bone.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For calamity from God is a terror to me,
VERSE:And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.
LABEL:24
VERSE:If I have made gold my hope,
VERSE:And have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
LABEL:25
VERSE:If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,
VERSE:And because my hand had gotten much;
LABEL:26
VERSE:If I have beheld the sun when it shined,
VERSE:Or the moon walking in brightness,
LABEL:27
VERSE:And my heart hath been secretly enticed,
VERSE:And my mouth hath kissed my hand:
LABEL:28
VERSE:This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
VERSE:For I should have denied the God that is above.
LABEL:29
VERSE:If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
VERSE:Or lifted up myself when evil found him
LABEL:30
VERSE:(Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin
VERSE:By asking his life with a curse);
LABEL:31
VERSE:If the men of my tent have not said,
VERSE:Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?
LABEL:32
VERSE:(The sojourner hath not lodged in the street;
VERSE:But I have opened my doors to the traveller);
LABEL:33
VERSE:If like Adam I have covered my transgressions,
VERSE:By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,
LABEL:34
VERSE:Because I feared the great multitude,
VERSE:And the contempt of families terrified me,
VERSE:So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door—
LABEL:35
VERSE:Oh that I had one to hear me!
VERSE:(Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me)
VERSE:And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!
LABEL:36
VERSE:Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder;
VERSE:I would bind it unto me as a crown:
LABEL:37
VERSE:I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
VERSE:As a prince would I go near unto him.
LABEL:38
VERSE:If my land crieth out against me,
VERSE:And the furrows thereof weep together;
LABEL:39
VERSE:If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
VERSE:Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
LABEL:40
VERSE:Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
VERSE:And cockle instead of barley.
VERSE:The words of Job are ended.
