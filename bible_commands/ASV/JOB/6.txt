CHAPTER:6
TITLE:Job 6
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Oh that my vexation were but weighed,
VERSE:And all my calamity laid in the balances!
LABEL:3
VERSE:For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas:
VERSE:Therefore have my words been rash.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
VERSE:The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up:
VERSE:The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
VERSE:Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt?
VERSE:Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
LABEL:7
VERSE:My soul refuseth to touch them;
VERSE:They are as loathsome food to me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Oh that I might have my request;
VERSE:And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
LABEL:9
VERSE:Even that it would please God to crush me;
VERSE:That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
LABEL:10
VERSE:And be it still my consolation,
VERSE:Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not,
VERSE:That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
LABEL:11
VERSE:What is my strength, that I should wait?
VERSE:And what is mine end, that I should be patient?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Is my strength the strength of stones?
VERSE:Or is my flesh of brass?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Is it not that I have no help in me,
VERSE:And that wisdom is driven quite from me?
LABEL:14
VERSE:To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend;
VERSE:Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
VERSE:As the channel of brooks that pass away;
LABEL:16
VERSE:Which are black by reason of the ice,
VERSE:And wherein the snow hideth itself:
LABEL:17
VERSE:What time they wax warm, they vanish;
VERSE:When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside;
VERSE:They go up into the waste, and perish.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The caravans of Tema looked,
VERSE:The companies of Sheba waited for them.
LABEL:20
VERSE:They were put to shame because they had hoped;
VERSE:They came thither, and were confounded.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For now ye are nothing;
VERSE:Ye see a terror, and are afraid.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Did I say, Give unto me?
VERSE:Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Or, Deliver me from the adversaryâ€™s hand?
VERSE:Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Teach me, and I will hold my peace;
VERSE:And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
LABEL:25
VERSE:How forcible are words of uprightness!
VERSE:But your reproof, what doth it reprove?
LABEL:26
VERSE:Do ye think to reprove words,
VERSE:Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?
LABEL:27
VERSE:Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless,
VERSE:And make merchandise of your friend.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Now therefore be pleased to look upon me;
VERSE:For surely I shall not lie to your face.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice;
VERSE:Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Is there injustice on my tongue?
VERSE:Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
