CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Job 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And Job answered and said:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Let the day perish wherein I was born,
VERSE:And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let that day be darkness;
VERSE:Let not God from above seek for it,
VERSE:Neither let the light shine upon it.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own;
VERSE:Let a cloud dwell upon it;
VERSE:Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.
LABEL:6
VERSE:As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it:
VERSE:Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;
VERSE:Let it not come into the number of the months.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Lo, let that night be barren;
VERSE:Let no joyful voice come therein.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let them curse it that curse the day,
VERSE:Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark:
VERSE:Let it look for light, but have none;
VERSE:Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:
LABEL:10
VERSE:Because it shut not up the doors of my motherâ€™s womb,
VERSE:Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Why died I not from the womb?
VERSE:Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why did the knees receive me?
VERSE:Or why the breasts, that I should suck?
LABEL:13
VERSE:For now should I have lain down and been quiet;
VERSE:I should have slept; then had I been at rest,
LABEL:14
VERSE:With kings and counsellors of the earth,
VERSE:Who built up waste places for themselves;
LABEL:15
VERSE:Or with princes that had gold,
VERSE:Who filled their houses with silver:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,
VERSE:As infants that never saw light.
LABEL:17
VERSE:There the wicked cease from troubling;
VERSE:And there the weary are at rest.
LABEL:18
VERSE:There the prisoners are at ease together;
VERSE:They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The small and the great are there:
VERSE:And the servant is free from his master.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
VERSE:And life unto the bitter in soul;
LABEL:21
VERSE:Who long for death, but it cometh not,
VERSE:And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
LABEL:22
VERSE:Who rejoice exceedingly,
VERSE:And are glad, when they can find the grave?
LABEL:23
VERSE:  Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,
VERSE:And whom God hath hedged in?
LABEL:24
VERSE:For my sighing cometh before I eat,
VERSE:And my groanings are poured out like water.
LABEL:25
VERSE:For the thing which I fear cometh upon me,
VERSE:And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;
VERSE:But trouble cometh.
