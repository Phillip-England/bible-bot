CHAPTER:29
TITLE:Job 29
LABEL:1
VERSE:And Job again took up his parable, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Oh that I were as in the months of old,
VERSE:As in the days when God watched over me;
LABEL:3
VERSE:When his lamp shined upon my head,
VERSE:And by his light I walked through darkness;
LABEL:4
VERSE:As I was in the ripeness of my days,
VERSE:When the friendship of God was upon my tent;
LABEL:5
VERSE:When the Almighty was yet with me,
VERSE:And my children were about me;
LABEL:6
VERSE:When my steps were washed with butter,
VERSE:And the rock poured me out streams of oil!
LABEL:7
VERSE:When I went forth to the gate unto the city,
VERSE:When I prepared my seat in the street,
LABEL:8
VERSE:The young men saw me and hid themselves,
VERSE:And the aged rose up and stood;
LABEL:9
VERSE:The princes refrained from talking,
VERSE:And laid their hand on their mouth;
LABEL:10
VERSE:The voice of the nobles was hushed,
VERSE:And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
VERSE:And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:
LABEL:12
VERSE:Because I delivered the poor that cried,
VERSE:The fatherless also, that had none to help him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me;
VERSE:And I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
VERSE:My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I was eyes to the blind,
VERSE:And feet was I to the lame.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I was a father to the needy:
VERSE:And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous,
VERSE:And plucked the prey out of his teeth.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Then I said, I shall die in my nest,
VERSE:And I shall multiply my days as the sand:
LABEL:19
VERSE:My root is spread out to the waters,
VERSE:And the dew lieth all night upon my branch:
LABEL:20
VERSE:My glory is fresh in me,
VERSE:And my bow is renewed in my hand.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Unto me men gave ear, and waited,
VERSE:And kept silence for my counsel.
LABEL:22
VERSE:After my words they spake not again;
VERSE:And my speech distilled upon them.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And they waited for me as for the rain;
VERSE:And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
LABEL:24
VERSE:I smiled on them, when they had no confidence;
VERSE:And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I chose out their way, and sat as chief,
VERSE:And dwelt as a king in the army,
VERSE:As one that comforteth the mourners.
