CHAPTER:1
TITLE:2 Samuel 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
LABEL:2
VERSE:it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
LABEL:6
VERSE:And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
LABEL:12
VERSE:and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed?
LABEL:15
VERSE:And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah’s anointed.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
LABEL:18
VERSE:(and he bade them teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places!
VERSE:How are the mighty fallen!
LABEL:20
VERSE:Tell it not in Gath,
VERSE:Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;
VERSE:Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
VERSE:Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Ye mountains of Gilboa,
VERSE:Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings:
VERSE:For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,
VERSE:The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
LABEL:22
VERSE:From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
VERSE:The bow of Jonathan turned not back,
VERSE:And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
VERSE:And in their death they were not divided:
VERSE:They were swifter than eagles,
VERSE:They were stronger than lions.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
VERSE:Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,
VERSE:Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
LABEL:25
VERSE:How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
VERSE:Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:
VERSE:Very pleasant hast thou been unto me:
VERSE:Thy love to me was wonderful,
VERSE:Passing the love of women.
LABEL:27
VERSE:How are the mighty fallen,
VERSE:And the weapons of war perished!
