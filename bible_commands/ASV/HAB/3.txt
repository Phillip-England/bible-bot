CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Habakkuk 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid:
VERSE:O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years;
VERSE:In the midst of the years make it known;
VERSE:In wrath remember mercy.
LABEL:3
VERSE:God came from Teman,
VERSE:And the Holy One from mount Paran. [Selah
VERSE:His glory covered the heavens,
VERSE:And the earth was full of his praise.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And his brightness was as the light;
VERSE:He had rays coming forth from his hand;
VERSE:And there was the hiding of his power.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Before him went the pestilence,
VERSE:And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He stood, and measured the earth;
VERSE:He beheld, and drove asunder the nations;
VERSE:And the eternal mountains were scattered;
VERSE:The everlasting hills did bow;
VERSE:His goings were as of old.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;
VERSE:The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers?
VERSE:Was thine anger against the rivers,
VERSE:Or thy wrath against the sea,
VERSE:That thou didst ride upon thy horses,
VERSE:Upon thy chariots of salvation?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thy bow was made quite bare;
VERSE:The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. [Selah
VERSE:Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The mountains saw thee, and were afraid;
VERSE:The tempest of waters passed by;
VERSE:The deep uttered its voice,
VERSE:And lifted up its hands on high.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The sun and moon stood still in their habitation,
VERSE:At the light of thine arrows as they went,
VERSE:At the shining of thy glittering spear.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Thou didst march through the land in indignation;
VERSE:Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,
VERSE:For the salvation of thine anointed;
VERSE:Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked man,
VERSE:Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. [Selah
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors:
VERSE:They came as a whirlwind to scatter me;
VERSE:Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses,
VERSE:The heap of mighty waters.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I heard, and my body trembled,
VERSE:My lips quivered at the voice;
VERSE:Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place;
VERSE:Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,
VERSE:For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For though the fig-tree shall not flourish,
VERSE:Neither shall fruit be in the vines;
VERSE:The labor of the olive shall fail,
VERSE:And the fields shall yield no food;
VERSE:The flock shall be cut off from the fold,
VERSE:And there shall be no herd in the stalls:
LABEL:18
VERSE:Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah,
VERSE:I will joy in the God of my salvation.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength;
VERSE:And he maketh my feet like hindsâ€™ feet,
VERSE:And will make me to walk upon my high places.
VERSE:For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments.
