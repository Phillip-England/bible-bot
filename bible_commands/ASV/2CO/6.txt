CHAPTER:6
TITLE:2 Corinthians 6
LABEL:1
VERSE:And working together with him we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain
LABEL:2
VERSE:(for he saith,
VERSE:At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee,
VERSE:And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:
VERSE:behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):
LABEL:3
VERSE:giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;
LABEL:4
VERSE:but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
LABEL:5
VERSE:in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
LABEL:6
VERSE:in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
LABEL:7
VERSE:in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
LABEL:8
VERSE:by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;
LABEL:9
VERSE:as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
LABEL:10
VERSE:as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?
LABEL:15
VERSE:And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?
LABEL:16
VERSE:And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Wherefore
VERSE:Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate,
VERSE:saith the Lord,
VERSE:And touch no unclean thing;
VERSE:And I will receive you,
LABEL:18
VERSE:And will be to you a Father,
VERSE:And ye shall be to me sons and daughters,
VERSE:saith the Lord Almighty.
