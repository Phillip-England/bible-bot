VERSE:But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

VERSE:Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoesâ€”

VERSE:they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the same maiden, to profane my holy name:

VERSE:and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.

VERSE:Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

LABEL:16
VERSE:and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith Jehovah.
