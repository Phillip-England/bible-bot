CHAPTER:8
TITLE:Hebrews 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
LABEL:2
VERSE:a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;
LABEL:5
VERSE:who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned of God when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.
LABEL:6
VERSE:But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For finding fault with them, he saith,
VERSE:Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
VERSE:That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
LABEL:9
VERSE:Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
VERSE:In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt;
VERSE:For they continued not in my covenant,
VERSE:And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
VERSE:After those days, saith the Lord;
VERSE:I will put my laws into their mind,
VERSE:And on their heart also will I write them:
VERSE:And I will be to them a God,
VERSE:And they shall be to me a people:
LABEL:11
VERSE:And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen,
VERSE:And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord:
VERSE:For all shall know me,
VERSE:From the least to the greatest of them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For I will be merciful to their iniquities,
VERSE:And their sins will I remember no more.
LABEL:13
VERSE:In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.
