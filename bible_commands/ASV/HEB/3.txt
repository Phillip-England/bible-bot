CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Hebrews 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus;
LABEL:2
VERSE:who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;
LABEL:6
VERSE:but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith,
VERSE:To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
LABEL:8
VERSE:Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
VERSE:Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
LABEL:9
VERSE:Where your fathers tried me by proving me,
VERSE:And saw my works forty years.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Wherefore I was displeased with this generation,
VERSE:And said, They do always err in their heart:
VERSE:But they did not know my ways;
LABEL:11
VERSE:As I sware in my wrath,
VERSE:They shall not enter into my rest.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:
LABEL:13
VERSE:but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:
LABEL:14
VERSE:for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:
LABEL:15
VERSE:while it is said,
VERSE:To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
VERSE:Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?
LABEL:17
VERSE:And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
LABEL:18
VERSE:And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?
LABEL:19
VERSE:And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
