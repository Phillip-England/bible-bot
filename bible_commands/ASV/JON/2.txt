TITLE:Jonah 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fishâ€™s belly.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And he said,
VERSE:I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah,
VERSE:And he answered me;
VERSE:Out of the belly of Sheol cried I,
VERSE:And thou heardest my voice.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas,
VERSE:And the flood was round about me;
VERSE:All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes;
VERSE:Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The waters compassed me about, even to the soul;
VERSE:The deep was round about me;
VERSE:The weeds were wrapped about my head.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
VERSE:The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever:
VERSE:Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
LABEL:7
VERSE:When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah;
VERSE:And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They that regard lying vanities
VERSE:Forsake their own mercy.
LABEL:9
VERSE:But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
VERSE:I will pay that which I have vowed.
VERSE:Salvation is of Jehovah.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
