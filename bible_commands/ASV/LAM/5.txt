CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Lamentations 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us:
VERSE:Behold, and see our reproach.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Our inheritance is turned unto strangers,
VERSE:Our houses unto aliens.
LABEL:3
VERSE:We are orphans and fatherless;
VERSE:Our mothers are as widows.
LABEL:4
VERSE:We have drunken our water for money;
VERSE:Our wood is sold unto us.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Our pursuers are upon our necks:
VERSE:We are weary, and have no rest.
LABEL:6
VERSE:We have given the hand to the Egyptians,
VERSE:And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Our fathers sinned, and are not;
VERSE:And we have borne their iniquities.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Servants rule over us:
VERSE:There is none to deliver us out of their hand.
LABEL:9
VERSE:We get our bread at the peril of our lives,
VERSE:Because of the sword of the wilderness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Our skin is black like an oven,
VERSE:Because of the burning heat of famine.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They ravished the women in Zion,
VERSE:The virgins in the cities of Judah.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Princes were hanged up by their hand:
VERSE:The faces of elders were not honored.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The young men bare the mill;
VERSE:And the children stumbled under the wood.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The elders have ceased from the gate,
VERSE:The young men from their music.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The joy of our heart is ceased;
VERSE:Our dance is turned into mourning.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The crown is fallen from our head:
VERSE:Woe unto us! for we have sinned.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For this our heart is faint;
VERSE:For these things our eyes are dim;
LABEL:18
VERSE:For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate:
VERSE:The foxes walk upon it.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever;
VERSE:Thy throne is from generation to generation.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
VERSE:And forsake us so long time?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned;
VERSE:Renew our days as of old.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But thou hast utterly rejected us;
VERSE:Thou art very wroth against us.
