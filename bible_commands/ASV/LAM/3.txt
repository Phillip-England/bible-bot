CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Lamentations 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.
LABEL:4
VERSE:My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
LABEL:5
VERSE:He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.
LABEL:22
VERSE:  It is of Jehovahâ€™s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
LABEL:23
VERSE:They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.
LABEL:27
VERSE:It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For the Lord will not cast off for ever.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
LABEL:33
VERSE:For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.
LABEL:34
VERSE:To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
LABEL:35
VERSE:To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
LABEL:36
VERSE:To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
LABEL:37
VERSE:Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
LABEL:38
VERSE:Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?
LABEL:39
VERSE:Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
LABEL:40
VERSE:Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
LABEL:42
VERSE:We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.
LABEL:45
VERSE:Thou hast made us an offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.
LABEL:46
VERSE:All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
LABEL:47
VERSE:Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.
LABEL:48
VERSE:Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LABEL:49
VERSE:Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
LABEL:50
VERSE:Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.
LABEL:51
VERSE:Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
LABEL:52
VERSE:They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.
LABEL:53
VERSE:They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.
LABEL:54
VERSE:Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.
LABEL:55
VERSE:I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.
LABEL:56
VERSE:Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
LABEL:57
VERSE:Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.
LABEL:58
VERSE:O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
LABEL:59
VERSE:O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.
LABEL:60
VERSE:Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.
LABEL:61
VERSE:Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,
LABEL:62
VERSE:The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
LABEL:63
VERSE:Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.
LABEL:64
VERSE:Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.
LABEL:65
VERSE:Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.
LABEL:66
VERSE:Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.
