VERSE:to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
LABEL:5
VERSE:and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
LABEL:7
VERSE:the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent,

VERSE:and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,
