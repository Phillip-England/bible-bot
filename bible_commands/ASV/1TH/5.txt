BOOK:1TH
CHAPTER:5
TITLE:1 Thessalonians 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
LABEL:3
VERSE:When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:
LABEL:5
VERSE:for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;
LABEL:6
VERSE:so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
LABEL:10
VERSE:who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
LABEL:13
VERSE:and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their workâ€™s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.
LABEL:15
VERSE:See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Rejoice always;
LABEL:17
VERSE:pray without ceasing;
LABEL:18
VERSE:in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Quench not the Spirit;
LABEL:20
VERSE:despise not prophesyings;
LABEL:21
VERSE:prove all things; hold fast that which is good;
LABEL:22
VERSE:abstain from every form of evil.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Brethren, pray for us.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
LABEL:27
VERSE:I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
