CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Ezekiel 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.
LABEL:2
VERSE:So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
LABEL:6
VERSE:not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.
LABEL:9
VERSE:As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.
LABEL:11
VERSE:And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.
LABEL:14
VERSE:So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
LABEL:22
VERSE:And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
LABEL:25
VERSE:But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
LABEL:26
VERSE:and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
LABEL:27
VERSE:But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
