BOOK:1TH
CHAPTER:5
TITLE:1 Thessalonians 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.
LABEL:5
VERSE:You are all children of light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,
LABEL:6
VERSE:so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But since we belong to the day, let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
LABEL:10
VERSE:who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,
LABEL:13
VERSE:and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake.
VERSE:Be at peace among yourselves.
LABEL:14
VERSE:We exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient toward all.
LABEL:15
VERSE:See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Always rejoice.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Pray without ceasing.
LABEL:18
VERSE:In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Don’t quench the Spirit.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Don’t despise prophecies.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Abstain from every form of evil.
LABEL:23
VERSE:May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Brothers, pray for us.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
LABEL:27
VERSE:I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
