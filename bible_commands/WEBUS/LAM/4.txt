VERSE:How the gold has become dim!
VERSE:The most pure gold has changed!
VERSE:The stones of the sanctuary are poured out
VERSE:at the head of every street.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The precious sons of Zion,
VERSE:comparable to fine gold,
VERSE:how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers,
VERSE:the work of the hands of the potter!
LABEL:3
VERSE:Even the jackals offer their breast.
VERSE:They nurse their young ones.
VERSE:But the daughter of my people has become cruel,
VERSE:like the ostriches in the wilderness.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst.
VERSE:The young children ask for bread,
VERSE:and no one breaks it for them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets.
VERSE:Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,
VERSE:which was overthrown as in a moment.
VERSE:No hands were laid on her.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Her nobles were purer than snow.
VERSE:They were whiter than milk.
VERSE:They were more ruddy in body than rubies.
VERSE:Their polishing was like sapphire.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Their appearance is blacker than a coal.
VERSE:They are not known in the streets.
VERSE:Their skin clings to their bones.
VERSE:It is withered.
VERSE:It has become like wood.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;
VERSE:for these pine away, stricken through,
VERSE:for lack of the fruits of the field.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children.
VERSE:They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Yahweh has accomplished his wrath.
VERSE:He has poured out his fierce anger.
VERSE:He has kindled a fire in Zion,
VERSE:which has devoured its foundations.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The kings of the earth didn’t believe,
VERSE:neither did all the inhabitants of the world,
VERSE:that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
LABEL:13
VERSE:It is because of the sins of her prophets
VERSE:and the iniquities of her priests,
VERSE:that have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They wander as blind men in the streets.
VERSE:They are polluted with blood,
VERSE:So that men can’t touch their garments.
LABEL:15
VERSE:“Go away!” they cried to them.
VERSE:“Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch!
VERSE:When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations,
VERSE:“They can’t live here any more.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yahweh’s anger has scattered them.
VERSE:He will not pay attention to them any more.
VERSE:They didn’t respect the persons of the priests.
VERSE:They didn’t favor the elders.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Our eyes still fail,
VERSE:looking in vain for our help.
VERSE:In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They hunt our steps,
VERSE:so that we can’t go in our streets.
VERSE:Our end is near.
VERSE:Our days are fulfilled,
VERSE:for our end has come.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.
VERSE:They chased us on the mountains.
VERSE:They set an ambush for us in the wilderness.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The breath of our nostrils,
VERSE:the anointed of Yahweh,
VERSE:was taken in their pits;
VERSE:of whom we said,
VERSE:under his shadow we will live among the nations.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,
VERSE:who dwells in the land of Uz.
VERSE:The cup will pass through to you also.
VERSE:You will be drunken,
VERSE:and will make yourself naked.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion.
VERSE:He will no more carry you away into captivity.
VERSE:He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom.
VERSE:He will uncover your sins.
