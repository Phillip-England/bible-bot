CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Lamentations 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:I am the man who has seen affliction
VERSE:by the rod of his wrath.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness,
VERSE:and not in light.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Surely he turns his hand against me
VERSE:again and again all day long.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He has made my flesh and my skin old.
VERSE:He has broken my bones.
LABEL:5
VERSE:He has built against me,
VERSE:and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He has made me dwell in dark places,
VERSE:as those who have been long dead.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out.
VERSE:He has made my chain heavy.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yes, when I cry, and call for help,
VERSE:he shuts out my prayer.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He has walled up my ways with cut stone.
VERSE:He has made my paths crooked.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He is to me as a bear lying in wait,
VERSE:as a lion in hiding.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He has turned away my path,
VERSE:and pulled me in pieces.
VERSE:He has made me desolate.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He has bent his bow,
VERSE:and set me as a mark for the arrow.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I have become a derision to all my people,
VERSE:and their song all day long.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He has filled me with bitterness.
VERSE:He has stuffed me with wormwood.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He has also broken my teeth with gravel.
VERSE:He has covered me with ashes.
LABEL:17
VERSE:You have removed my soul far away from peace.
VERSE:I forgot prosperity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I said, “My strength has perished,
VERSE:along with my expectation from Yahweh.”
LABEL:19
VERSE:Remember my affliction and my misery,
VERSE:the wormwood and the bitterness.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My soul still remembers them,
VERSE:and is bowed down within me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:This I recall to my mind;
VERSE:therefore I have hope.
LABEL:22
VERSE:It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed,
VERSE:because his mercies don’t fail.
LABEL:23
VERSE:They are new every morning.
VERSE:Great is your faithfulness.
LABEL:24
VERSE:“Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul.
VERSE:“Therefore I will hope in him.”
LABEL:25
VERSE:Yahweh is good to those who wait for him,
VERSE:to the soul who seeks him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:It is good that a man should hope
VERSE:and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.
LABEL:27
VERSE:It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Let him sit alone and keep silence,
VERSE:because he has laid it on him.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Let him put his mouth in the dust,
VERSE:if it is so that there may be hope.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him.
VERSE:Let him be filled full of reproach.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For the Lord will not cast off forever.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For though he causes grief,
VERSE:yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
LABEL:33
VERSE:For he does not afflict willingly,
VERSE:nor grieve the children of men.
LABEL:34
VERSE:To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
LABEL:35
VERSE:to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
LABEL:36
VERSE:to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.
LABEL:37
VERSE:Who is he who says, and it comes to pass,
VERSE:when the Lord doesn’t command it?
LABEL:38
VERSE:Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?
LABEL:39
VERSE:Why should a living man complain,
VERSE:a man for the punishment of his sins?
LABEL:40
VERSE:Let us search and try our ways,
VERSE:and turn again to Yahweh.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.
LABEL:42
VERSE:“We have transgressed and have rebelled.
VERSE:You have not pardoned.
LABEL:43
VERSE:“You have covered us with anger and pursued us.
VERSE:You have killed.
VERSE:You have not pitied.
LABEL:44
VERSE:You have covered yourself with a cloud,
VERSE:so that no prayer can pass through.
LABEL:45
VERSE:You have made us an off-scouring and refuse
VERSE:in the middle of the peoples.
LABEL:46
VERSE:“All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
LABEL:47
VERSE:Terror and the pit have come on us,
VERSE:devastation and destruction.”
LABEL:48
VERSE:My eye runs down with streams of water,
VERSE:for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LABEL:49
VERSE:My eye pours down
VERSE:and doesn’t cease,
VERSE:without any intermission,
LABEL:50
VERSE:until Yahweh looks down,
VERSE:and sees from heaven.
LABEL:51
VERSE:My eye affects my soul,
VERSE:because of all the daughters of my city.
LABEL:52
VERSE:They have chased me relentlessly like a bird,
VERSE:those who are my enemies without cause.
LABEL:53
VERSE:They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
VERSE:and have cast a stone on me.
LABEL:54
VERSE:Waters flowed over my head.
VERSE:I said, “I am cut off.”
LABEL:55
VERSE:I called on your name, Yahweh,
VERSE:out of the lowest dungeon.
LABEL:56
VERSE:You heard my voice:
VERSE:“Don’t hide your ear from my sighing,
VERSE:and my cry.”
LABEL:57
VERSE:You came near in the day that I called on you.
VERSE:You said, “Don’t be afraid.”
LABEL:58
VERSE:Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul.
VERSE:You have redeemed my life.
LABEL:59
VERSE:Yahweh, you have seen my wrong.
VERSE:Judge my cause.
LABEL:60
VERSE:You have seen all their vengeance
VERSE:and all their plans against me.
LABEL:61
VERSE:You have heard their reproach, Yahweh,
VERSE:and all their plans against me,
LABEL:62
VERSE:the lips of those that rose up against me,
VERSE:and their plots against me all day long.
LABEL:63
VERSE:You see their sitting down and their rising up.
VERSE:I am their song.
LABEL:64
VERSE:You will pay them back, Yahweh,
VERSE:according to the work of their hands.
LABEL:65
VERSE:You will give them hardness of heart,
VERSE:your curse to them.
LABEL:66
VERSE:You will pursue them in anger,
VERSE:and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.
