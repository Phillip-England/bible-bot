TITLE:Ecclesiastes 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor;
VERSE:so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
LABEL:2
VERSE:A wise man’s heart is at his right hand,
VERSE:but a fool’s heart at his left.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.
LABEL:4
VERSE:If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.
LABEL:5
VERSE:There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it.
LABEL:10
VERSE:If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
LABEL:14
VERSE:A fool also multiplies words.
VERSE:Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?
LABEL:15
VERSE:The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,
VERSE:and your princes eat in the morning!
LABEL:17
VERSE:Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,
VERSE:and your princes eat in due season,
VERSE:for strength, and not for drunkenness!
LABEL:18
VERSE:By slothfulness the roof sinks in;
VERSE:and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.
LABEL:19
VERSE:A feast is made for laughter,
VERSE:and wine makes the life glad;
VERSE:and money is the answer for all things.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts;
VERSE:and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom,
VERSE:for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,
VERSE:and that which has wings may tell the matter.
