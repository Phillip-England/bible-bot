CHAPTER:12
TITLE:Ecclesiastes 12
LABEL:1
VERSE:Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,
VERSE:before the evil days come, and the years draw near,
VERSE:when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them;”
LABEL:2
VERSE:Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,
VERSE:and the clouds return after the rain;
LABEL:3
VERSE:in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
VERSE:and the strong men shall bow themselves,
VERSE:and the grinders cease because they are few,
VERSE:and those who look out of the windows are darkened,
LABEL:4
VERSE:and the doors shall be shut in the street;
VERSE:when the sound of the grinding is low,
VERSE:and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,
VERSE:and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
LABEL:5
VERSE:yes, they shall be afraid of heights,
VERSE:and terrors will be on the way;
VERSE:and the almond tree shall blossom,
VERSE:and the grasshopper shall be a burden,
VERSE:and desire shall fail;
VERSE:because man goes to his everlasting home,
VERSE:and the mourners go about the streets;
LABEL:6
VERSE:before the silver cord is severed,
VERSE:or the golden bowl is broken,
VERSE:or the pitcher is broken at the spring,
VERSE:or the wheel broken at the cistern,
LABEL:7
VERSE:and the dust returns to the earth as it was,
VERSE:and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher.
VERSE:“All is vanity!”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
LABEL:13
VERSE:This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.
