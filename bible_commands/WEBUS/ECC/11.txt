CHAPTER:11
TITLE:Ecclesiastes 11
LABEL:1
VERSE:Cast your bread on the waters;
VERSE:for you shall find it after many days.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight;
VERSE:for you don’t know what evil will be on the earth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;
VERSE:and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north,
VERSE:in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He who observes the wind won’t sow;
VERSE:and he who regards the clouds won’t reap.
LABEL:5
VERSE:As you don’t know what is the way of the wind,
VERSE:nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child;
VERSE:even so you don’t know the work of God who does all.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In the morning sow your seed,
VERSE:and in the evening don’t withhold your hand;
VERSE:for you don’t know which will prosper, whether this or that,
VERSE:or whether they both will be equally good.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Truly the light is sweet,
VERSE:and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to see the sun.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all;
VERSE:but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.
VERSE:All that comes is vanity.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Rejoice, young man, in your youth,
VERSE:and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth,
VERSE:and walk in the ways of your heart,
VERSE:and in the sight of your eyes;
VERSE:but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore remove sorrow from your heart,
VERSE:and put away evil from your flesh;
VERSE:for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
