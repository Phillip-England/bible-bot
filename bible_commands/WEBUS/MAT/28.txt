LABEL:1
VERSE:Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.

VERSE:Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it.
LABEL:3
VERSE:His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.

VERSE:As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!”
VERSE:They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.

VERSE:Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers   that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”

VERSE:Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.

VERSE:If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”
