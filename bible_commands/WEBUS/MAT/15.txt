CHAPTER:15
TITLE:Matthew 15
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”
LABEL:3
VERSE:He answered them, “Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’  and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’
LABEL:5
VERSE:But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”
LABEL:6
VERSE:he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
LABEL:7
VERSE:You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
LABEL:8
VERSE:  ‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,
VERSE:and honor me with their lips;
VERSE:but their heart is far from me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:  And they worship me in vain,
VERSE:teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”
LABEL:10
VERSE:He summoned the multitude, and said to them, “Hear, and understand.
LABEL:11
VERSE:That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”
LABEL:12
VERSE:Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”
LABEL:13
VERSE:But he answered, “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
LABEL:15
VERSE:Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:So Jesus said, “Do you also still not understand?
LABEL:17
VERSE:Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body?
LABEL:18
VERSE:But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.
LABEL:20
VERSE:These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”
LABEL:21
VERSE:Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”
LABEL:23
VERSE:But he answered her not a word.
VERSE:His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”
LABEL:24
VERSE:But he answered, “I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
LABEL:25
VERSE:But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
LABEL:26
VERSE:But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”
LABEL:27
VERSE:But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
LABEL:28
VERSE:Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
LABEL:31
VERSE:so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”
LABEL:33
VERSE:The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”
LABEL:34
VERSE:Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?”
VERSE:They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
LABEL:35
VERSE:He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
LABEL:36
VERSE:and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
LABEL:37
VERSE:They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
LABEL:38
VERSE:Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
