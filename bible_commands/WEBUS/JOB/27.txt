CHAPTER:27
TITLE:Job 27
LABEL:1
VERSE:Job again took up his parable, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“As God lives, who has taken away my right,
VERSE:the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter
LABEL:3
VERSE:(for the length of my life is still in me,
VERSE:and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);
LABEL:4
VERSE:surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness,
VERSE:neither will my tongue utter deceit.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Far be it from me that I should justify you.
VERSE:Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.
VERSE:My heart will not reproach me so long as I live.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Let my enemy be as the wicked.
VERSE:Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off,
VERSE:when God takes away his life?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Will he delight himself in the Almighty,
VERSE:and call on God at all times?
LABEL:11
VERSE:I will teach you about the hand of God.
VERSE:I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;
VERSE:why then have you become altogether vain?
LABEL:13
VERSE:“This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
VERSE:the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.
LABEL:14
VERSE:If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.
VERSE:His offspring will not be satisfied with bread.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Those who remain of him will be buried in death.
VERSE:His widows will make no lamentation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Though he heap up silver as the dust,
VERSE:and prepare clothing as the clay;
LABEL:17
VERSE:he may prepare it, but the just will put it on,
VERSE:and the innocent will divide the silver.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He builds his house as the moth,
VERSE:as a booth which the watchman makes.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He lies down rich, but he will not do so again.
VERSE:He opens his eyes, and he is not.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Terrors overtake him like waters.
VERSE:A storm steals him away in the night.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The east wind carries him away, and he departs.
VERSE:It sweeps him out of his place.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For it hurls at him, and does not spare,
VERSE:as he flees away from his hand.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Men will clap their hands at him,
VERSE:and will hiss him out of his place.
