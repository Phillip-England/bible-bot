TITLE:Job 19
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“How long will you torment me,
VERSE:and crush me with words?
LABEL:3
VERSE:You have reproached me ten times.
VERSE:You aren’t ashamed that you attack me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:If it is true that I have erred,
VERSE:my error remains with myself.
LABEL:5
VERSE:If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,
VERSE:and plead against me my reproach,
LABEL:6
VERSE:know now that God has subverted me,
VERSE:and has surrounded me with his net.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard.
VERSE:I cry for help, but there is no justice.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass,
VERSE:and has set darkness in my paths.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He has stripped me of my glory,
VERSE:and taken the crown from my head.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.
VERSE:He has plucked my hope up like a tree.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He has also kindled his wrath against me.
VERSE:He counts me among his adversaries.
LABEL:12
VERSE:His troops come on together,
VERSE:build a siege ramp against me,
VERSE:and encamp around my tent.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“He has put my brothers far from me.
VERSE:My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.
LABEL:14
VERSE:My relatives have gone away.
VERSE:My familiar friends have forgotten me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger.
VERSE:I am an alien in their sight.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer.
VERSE:I beg him with my mouth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:My breath is offensive to my wife.
VERSE:I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Even young children despise me.
VERSE:If I arise, they speak against me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:All my familiar friends abhor me.
VERSE:They whom I loved have turned against me.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.
VERSE:I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:“Have pity on me. Have pity on me, you my friends,
VERSE:for the hand of God has touched me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Why do you persecute me as God,
VERSE:and are not satisfied with my flesh?
LABEL:23
VERSE:“Oh that my words were now written!
VERSE:Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
LABEL:24
VERSE:That with an iron pen and lead
VERSE:they were engraved in the rock forever!
LABEL:25
VERSE:But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.
VERSE:In the end, he will stand upon the earth.
LABEL:26
VERSE:After my skin is destroyed,
VERSE:then I will see God in my flesh,
LABEL:27
VERSE:whom I, even I, will see on my side.
VERSE:My eyes will see, and not as a stranger.
VERSE:“My heart is consumed within me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’
VERSE:because the root of the matter is found in me,
LABEL:29
VERSE:be afraid of the sword,
VERSE:for wrath brings the punishments of the sword,
VERSE:that you may know there is a judgment.”
