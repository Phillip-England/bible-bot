CHAPTER:6
TITLE:Job 6
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Oh that my anguish were weighed,
VERSE:and all my calamity laid in the balances!
LABEL:3
VERSE:For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,
VERSE:therefore my words have been rash.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.
VERSE:My spirit drinks up their poison.
VERSE:The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?
VERSE:Or does the ox low over his fodder?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?
VERSE:Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
LABEL:7
VERSE:My soul refuses to touch them.
VERSE:They are as loathsome food to me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“Oh that I might have my request,
VERSE:that God would grant the thing that I long for,
LABEL:9
VERSE:even that it would please God to crush me;
VERSE:that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
LABEL:10
VERSE:Let it still be my consolation,
VERSE:yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,
VERSE:that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
LABEL:11
VERSE:What is my strength, that I should wait?
VERSE:What is my end, that I should be patient?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Is my strength the strength of stones?
VERSE:Or is my flesh of bronze?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Isn’t it that I have no help in me,
VERSE:that wisdom is driven away from me?
LABEL:14
VERSE:“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;
VERSE:even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
VERSE:as the channel of brooks that pass away;
LABEL:16
VERSE:which are black by reason of the ice,
VERSE:in which the snow hides itself.
LABEL:17
VERSE:In the dry season, they vanish.
VERSE:When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The caravans that travel beside them turn away.
VERSE:They go up into the waste, and perish.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The caravans of Tema looked.
VERSE:The companies of Sheba waited for them.
LABEL:20
VERSE:They were distressed because they were confident.
VERSE:They came there, and were confounded.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For now you are nothing.
VERSE:You see a terror, and are afraid.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Did I ever say, ‘Give to me’?
VERSE:or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance’?
LABEL:23
VERSE:or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’?
VERSE:or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?
LABEL:24
VERSE:“Teach me, and I will hold my peace.
VERSE:Cause me to understand my error.
LABEL:25
VERSE:How forcible are words of uprightness!
VERSE:But your reproof, what does it reprove?
LABEL:26
VERSE:Do you intend to reprove words,
VERSE:since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?
LABEL:27
VERSE:Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,
VERSE:and make merchandise of your friend.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Now therefore be pleased to look at me,
VERSE:for surely I will not lie to your face.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Please return.
VERSE:Let there be no injustice.
VERSE:Yes, return again.
VERSE:My cause is righteous.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Is there injustice on my tongue?
VERSE:Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?
