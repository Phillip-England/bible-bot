TITLE:Job 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?
VERSE:But who can withhold himself from speaking?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Behold, you have instructed many,
VERSE:you have strengthened the weak hands.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Your words have supported him who was falling,
VERSE:you have made the feeble knees firm.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But now it has come to you, and you faint.
VERSE:It touches you, and you are troubled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Isn’t your piety your confidence?
VERSE:Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Remember, now, who ever perished, being innocent?
VERSE:Or where were the upright cut off?
LABEL:8
VERSE:According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity
VERSE:and sow trouble, reap the same.
LABEL:9
VERSE:By the breath of God they perish.
VERSE:By the blast of his anger are they consumed.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The roaring of the lion,
VERSE:and the voice of the fierce lion,
VERSE:the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The old lion perishes for lack of prey.
VERSE:The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Now a thing was secretly brought to me.
VERSE:My ear received a whisper of it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:In thoughts from the visions of the night,
VERSE:when deep sleep falls on men,
LABEL:14
VERSE:fear came on me, and trembling,
VERSE:which made all my bones shake.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then a spirit passed before my face.
VERSE:The hair of my flesh stood up.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance.
VERSE:A form was before my eyes.
VERSE:Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,
LABEL:17
VERSE:‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?
VERSE:Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.
VERSE:He charges his angels with error.
LABEL:19
VERSE:How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
VERSE:whose foundation is in the dust,
VERSE:who are crushed before the moth!
LABEL:20
VERSE:Between morning and evening they are destroyed.
VERSE:They perish forever without any regarding it.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?
VERSE:They die, and that without wisdom.’
