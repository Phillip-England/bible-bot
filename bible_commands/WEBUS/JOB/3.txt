CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Job 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Job answered:
LABEL:3
VERSE:“Let the day perish in which I was born,
VERSE:the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let that day be darkness.
VERSE:Don’t let God from above seek for it,
VERSE:neither let the light shine on it.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.
VERSE:Let a cloud dwell on it.
VERSE:Let all that makes the day black terrify it.
LABEL:6
VERSE:As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.
VERSE:Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.
VERSE:Let it not come into the number of the months.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, let that night be barren.
VERSE:Let no joyful voice come therein.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let them curse it who curse the day,
VERSE:who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let the stars of its twilight be dark.
VERSE:Let it look for light, but have none,
VERSE:neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,
LABEL:10
VERSE:because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,
VERSE:nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“Why didn’t I die from the womb?
VERSE:Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why did the knees receive me?
VERSE:Or why the breast, that I should nurse?
LABEL:13
VERSE:For now I should have lain down and been quiet.
VERSE:I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,
LABEL:14
VERSE:with kings and counselors of the earth,
VERSE:who built up waste places for themselves;
LABEL:15
VERSE:or with princes who had gold,
VERSE:who filled their houses with silver;
LABEL:16
VERSE:or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,
VERSE:as infants who never saw light.
LABEL:17
VERSE:There the wicked cease from troubling.
VERSE:There the weary are at rest.
LABEL:18
VERSE:There the prisoners are at ease together.
VERSE:They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The small and the great are there.
VERSE:The servant is free from his master.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“Why is light given to him who is in misery,
VERSE:life to the bitter in soul,
LABEL:21
VERSE:who long for death, but it doesn’t come;
VERSE:and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
LABEL:22
VERSE:who rejoice exceedingly,
VERSE:and are glad, when they can find the grave?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,
VERSE:whom God has hedged in?
LABEL:24
VERSE:For my sighing comes before I eat.
VERSE:My groanings are poured out like water.
LABEL:25
VERSE:For the thing which I fear comes on me,
VERSE:that which I am afraid of comes to me.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest;
VERSE:but trouble comes.”
