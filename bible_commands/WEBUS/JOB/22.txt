CHAPTER:22
TITLE:Job 22
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Can a man be profitable to God?
VERSE:Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?
VERSE:Or does it benefit him that you make your ways perfect?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Is it for your piety that he reproves you,
VERSE:that he enters with you into judgment?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Isn’t your wickedness great?
VERSE:Neither is there any end to your iniquities.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,
VERSE:and stripped the naked of their clothing.
LABEL:7
VERSE:You haven’t given water to the weary to drink,
VERSE:and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.
VERSE:The honorable man, he lived in it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:You have sent widows away empty,
VERSE:and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore snares are around you.
VERSE:Sudden fear troubles you,
LABEL:11
VERSE:or darkness, so that you can not see,
VERSE:and floods of waters cover you.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Isn’t God in the heights of heaven?
VERSE:See the height of the stars, how high they are!
LABEL:13
VERSE:You say, ‘What does God know?
VERSE:Can he judge through the thick darkness?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see.
VERSE:He walks on the vault of the sky.’
LABEL:15
VERSE:Will you keep the old way,
VERSE:which wicked men have trodden,
LABEL:16
VERSE:who were snatched away before their time,
VERSE:whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
LABEL:17
VERSE:who said to God, ‘Depart from us!’
VERSE:and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’
LABEL:18
VERSE:Yet he filled their houses with good things,
VERSE:but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The righteous see it, and are glad.
VERSE:The innocent ridicule them,
LABEL:20
VERSE:saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off.
VERSE:The fire has consumed their remnant.’
LABEL:21
VERSE:“Acquaint yourself with him now, and be at peace.
VERSE:By it, good will come to you.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Please receive instruction from his mouth,
VERSE:and lay up his words in your heart.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up,
VERSE:if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Lay your treasure in the dust,
VERSE:the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The Almighty will be your treasure,
VERSE:and precious silver to you.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,
VERSE:and will lift up your face to God.
LABEL:27
VERSE:You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.
VERSE:You will pay your vows.
LABEL:28
VERSE:You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you.
VERSE:Light will shine on your ways.
LABEL:29
VERSE:When they cast down, you will say, ‘be lifted up.’
VERSE:He will save the humble person.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He will even deliver him who is not innocent.
VERSE:Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
