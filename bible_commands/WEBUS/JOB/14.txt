CHAPTER:14
TITLE:Job 14
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Man, who is born of a woman,
VERSE:is of few days, and full of trouble.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He grows up like a flower, and is cut down.
VERSE:He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Do you open your eyes on such a one,
VERSE:and bring me into judgment with you?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
VERSE:Not one.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Seeing his days are determined,
VERSE:the number of his months is with you,
VERSE:and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Look away from him, that he may rest,
VERSE:until he accomplishes, as a hireling, his day.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down,
VERSE:that it will sprout again,
VERSE:that the tender branch of it will not cease.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Though its root grows old in the earth,
VERSE:and its stock dies in the ground,
LABEL:9
VERSE:yet through the scent of water it will bud,
VERSE:and sprout boughs like a plant.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But man dies, and is laid low.
VERSE:Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?
LABEL:11
VERSE:As the waters fail from the sea,
VERSE:and the river wastes and dries up,
LABEL:12
VERSE:so man lies down and doesn’t rise.
VERSE:Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake,
VERSE:nor be roused out of their sleep.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,
VERSE:that you would keep me secret until your wrath is past,
VERSE:that you would appoint me a set time and remember me!
LABEL:14
VERSE:If a man dies, will he live again?
VERSE:I would wait all the days of my warfare,
VERSE:until my release should come.
LABEL:15
VERSE:You would call, and I would answer you.
VERSE:You would have a desire for the work of your hands.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But now you count my steps.
VERSE:Don’t you watch over my sin?
LABEL:17
VERSE:My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.
VERSE:You fasten up my iniquity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:“But the mountain falling comes to nothing.
VERSE:The rock is removed out of its place.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The waters wear the stones.
VERSE:The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth.
VERSE:So you destroy the hope of man.
LABEL:20
VERSE:You forever prevail against him, and he departs.
VERSE:You change his face, and send him away.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it.
VERSE:They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But his flesh on him has pain,
VERSE:and his soul within him mourns.”
