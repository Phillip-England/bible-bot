VERSE:Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Therefore my thoughts answer me,
VERSE:even by reason of my haste that is in me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.
VERSE:The spirit of my understanding answers me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Don’t you know this from old time,
VERSE:since man was placed on earth,
LABEL:5
VERSE:that the triumphing of the wicked is short,
VERSE:the joy of the godless but for a moment?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Though his height mount up to the heavens,
VERSE:and his head reach to the clouds,
LABEL:7
VERSE:yet he will perish forever like his own dung.
VERSE:Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
LABEL:8
VERSE:He will fly away as a dream, and will not be found.
VERSE:Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The eye which saw him will see him no more,
VERSE:neither will his place see him any more.
LABEL:10
VERSE:His children will seek the favor of the poor.
VERSE:His hands will give back his wealth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:His bones are full of his youth,
VERSE:but youth will lie down with him in the dust.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
VERSE:though he hide it under his tongue,
LABEL:13
VERSE:though he spare it, and will not let it go,
VERSE:but keep it still within his mouth,
LABEL:14
VERSE:yet his food in his bowels is turned.
VERSE:It is cobra venom within him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He has swallowed down riches, and he will vomit them up again.
VERSE:God will cast them out of his belly.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He will suck cobra venom.
VERSE:The viper’s tongue will kill him.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He will not look at the rivers,
VERSE:the flowing streams of honey and butter.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He will restore that for which he labored, and will not swallow it down.
VERSE:He will not rejoice according to the substance that he has gotten.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.
VERSE:He has violently taken away a house, and he will not build it up.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“Because he knew no quietness within him,
VERSE:he will not save anything of that in which he delights.
LABEL:21
VERSE:There was nothing left that he didn’t devour,
VERSE:therefore his prosperity will not endure.
LABEL:22
VERSE:In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress will overtake him.
VERSE:The hand of everyone who is in misery will come on him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him.
VERSE:It will rain on him while he is eating.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He will flee from the iron weapon.
VERSE:The bronze arrow will strike him through.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He draws it out, and it comes out of his body.
VERSE:Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver.
VERSE:Terrors are on him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:All darkness is laid up for his treasures.
VERSE:An unfanned fire will devour him.
VERSE:It will consume that which is left in his tent.
LABEL:27
VERSE:The heavens will reveal his iniquity.
VERSE:The earth will rise up against him.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The increase of his house will depart.
VERSE:They will rush away in the day of his wrath.
LABEL:29
VERSE:This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
VERSE:the heritage appointed to him by God.”
