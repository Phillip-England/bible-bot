CHAPTER:29
TITLE:Job 29
LABEL:1
VERSE:Job again took up his parable, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Oh that I were as in the months of old,
VERSE:as in the days when God watched over me;
LABEL:3
VERSE:when his lamp shone on my head,
VERSE:and by his light I walked through darkness,
LABEL:4
VERSE:as I was in my prime,
VERSE:when the friendship of God was in my tent,
LABEL:5
VERSE:when the Almighty was yet with me,
VERSE:and my children were around me,
LABEL:6
VERSE:when my steps were washed with butter,
VERSE:and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,
LABEL:7
VERSE:when I went out to the city gate,
VERSE:when I prepared my seat in the street.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The young men saw me and hid themselves.
VERSE:The aged rose up and stood.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The princes refrained from talking,
VERSE:and laid their hand on their mouth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The voice of the nobles was hushed,
VERSE:and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me,
VERSE:and when the eye saw me, it commended me,
LABEL:12
VERSE:because I delivered the poor who cried,
VERSE:and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,
LABEL:13
VERSE:the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,
VERSE:and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.
VERSE:My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I was eyes to the blind,
VERSE:and feet to the lame.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I was a father to the needy.
VERSE:I researched the cause of him whom I didn’t know.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I broke the jaws of the unrighteous
VERSE:and plucked the prey out of his teeth.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Then I said, ‘I will die in my own house,
VERSE:I will count my days as the sand.
LABEL:19
VERSE:My root is spread out to the waters.
VERSE:The dew lies all night on my branch.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My glory is fresh in me.
VERSE:My bow is renewed in my hand.’
LABEL:21
VERSE:“Men listened to me, waited,
VERSE:and kept silence for my counsel.
LABEL:22
VERSE:After my words they didn’t speak again.
VERSE:My speech fell on them.
LABEL:23
VERSE:They waited for me as for the rain.
VERSE:Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.
LABEL:24
VERSE:I smiled on them when they had no confidence.
VERSE:They didn’t reject the light of my face.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I chose out their way, and sat as chief.
VERSE:I lived as a king in the army,
VERSE:as one who comforts the mourners.
