TITLE:Job 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Truly I know that it is so,
VERSE:but how can man be just with God?
LABEL:3
VERSE:If he is pleased to contend with him,
VERSE:he can’t answer him one time in a thousand.
LABEL:4
VERSE:God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength.
VERSE:Who has hardened himself against him and prospered?
LABEL:5
VERSE:He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it,
VERSE:when he overturns them in his anger.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He shakes the earth out of its place.
VERSE:Its pillars tremble.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He commands the sun and it doesn’t rise,
VERSE:and seals up the stars.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He alone stretches out the heavens,
VERSE:and treads on the waves of the sea.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
VERSE:and the rooms of the south.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He does great things past finding out;
VERSE:yes, marvelous things without number.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him.
VERSE:He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, he snatches away.
VERSE:Who can hinder him?
VERSE:Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’
LABEL:13
VERSE:“God will not withdraw his anger.
VERSE:The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.
LABEL:14
VERSE:How much less will I answer him,
VERSE:and choose my words to argue with him?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him.
VERSE:I would make supplication to my judge.
LABEL:16
VERSE:If I had called, and he had answered me,
VERSE:yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For he breaks me with a storm,
VERSE:and multiplies my wounds without cause.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He will not allow me to catch my breath,
VERSE:but fills me with bitterness.
LABEL:19
VERSE:If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!
VERSE:If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’
LABEL:20
VERSE:Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me.
VERSE:Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse.
LABEL:21
VERSE:I am blameless.
VERSE:I don’t respect myself.
VERSE:I despise my life.
LABEL:22
VERSE:“It is all the same.
VERSE:Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If the scourge kills suddenly,
VERSE:he will mock at the trial of the innocent.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.
VERSE:He covers the faces of its judges.
VERSE:If not he, then who is it?
LABEL:25
VERSE:“Now my days are swifter than a runner.
VERSE:They flee away. They see no good.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They have passed away as the swift ships,
VERSE:as the eagle that swoops on the prey.
LABEL:27
VERSE:If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
VERSE:I will put off my sad face, and cheer up,’
LABEL:28
VERSE:I am afraid of all my sorrows.
VERSE:I know that you will not hold me innocent.
LABEL:29
VERSE:I will be condemned.
VERSE:Why then do I labor in vain?
LABEL:30
VERSE:If I wash myself with snow,
VERSE:and cleanse my hands with lye,
LABEL:31
VERSE:yet you will plunge me in the ditch.
VERSE:My own clothes will abhor me.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,
VERSE:that we should come together in judgment.
LABEL:33
VERSE:There is no umpire between us,
VERSE:that might lay his hand on us both.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Let him take his rod away from me.
VERSE:Let his terror not make me afraid;
LABEL:35
VERSE:then I would speak, and not fear him,
VERSE:for I am not so in myself.
