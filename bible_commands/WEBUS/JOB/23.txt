VERSE:Then Job answered,

VERSE:“Even today my complaint is rebellious.
VERSE:His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Oh that I knew where I might find him!
VERSE:That I might come even to his seat!
LABEL:4
VERSE:I would set my cause in order before him,
VERSE:and fill my mouth with arguments.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I would know the words which he would answer me,
VERSE:and understand what he would tell me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
VERSE:No, but he would listen to me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:There the upright might reason with him,
VERSE:so I should be delivered forever from my judge.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“If I go east, he is not there.
VERSE:If I go west, I can’t find him.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He works to the north, but I can’t see him.
VERSE:He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But he knows the way that I take.
VERSE:When he has tried me, I will come out like gold.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My foot has held fast to his steps.
VERSE:I have kept his way, and not turned away.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips.
VERSE:I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?
VERSE:What his soul desires, even that he does.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For he performs that which is appointed for me.
VERSE:Many such things are with him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore I am terrified at his presence.
VERSE:When I consider, I am afraid of him.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For God has made my heart faint.
VERSE:The Almighty has terrified me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Because I was not cut off before the darkness,
VERSE:neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
