TITLE:Job 11
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered?
VERSE:Should a man full of talk be justified?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Should your boastings make men hold their peace?
VERSE:When you mock, will no man make you ashamed?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure.
VERSE:I am clean in your eyes.’
LABEL:5
VERSE:But oh that God would speak,
VERSE:and open his lips against you,
LABEL:6
VERSE:that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!
VERSE:For true wisdom has two sides.
VERSE:Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Can you fathom the mystery of God?
VERSE:Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
LABEL:8
VERSE:They are high as heaven. What can you do?
VERSE:They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Its measure is longer than the earth,
VERSE:and broader than the sea.
LABEL:10
VERSE:If he passes by, or confines,
VERSE:or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?
LABEL:11
VERSE:For he knows false men.
VERSE:He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it.
LABEL:12
VERSE:An empty-headed man becomes wise
VERSE:when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“If you set your heart aright,
VERSE:stretch out your hands toward him.
LABEL:14
VERSE:If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away.
VERSE:Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Surely then you will lift up your face without spot.
VERSE:Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear,
LABEL:16
VERSE:for you will forget your misery.
VERSE:You will remember it like waters that have passed away.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Life will be clearer than the noonday.
VERSE:Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning.
LABEL:18
VERSE:You will be secure, because there is hope.
VERSE:Yes, you will search, and will take your rest in safety.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Also you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid.
VERSE:Yes, many will court your favor.
LABEL:20
VERSE:But the eyes of the wicked will fail.
VERSE:They will have no way to flee.
VERSE:Their hope will be the giving up of the spirit.”
