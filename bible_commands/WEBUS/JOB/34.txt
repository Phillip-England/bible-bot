CHAPTER:34
TITLE:Job 34
LABEL:1
VERSE:Moreover Elihu answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Hear my words, you wise men.
VERSE:Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the ear tries words,
VERSE:as the palate tastes food.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let us choose for us that which is right.
VERSE:Let us know among ourselves what is good.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,
VERSE:God has taken away my right.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.
VERSE:My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’
LABEL:7
VERSE:What man is like Job,
VERSE:who drinks scorn like water,
LABEL:8
VERSE:who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,
VERSE:and walks with wicked men?
LABEL:9
VERSE:For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing
VERSE:that he should delight himself with God.’
LABEL:10
VERSE:“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:
VERSE:far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,
VERSE:from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For the work of a man he will render to him,
VERSE:and cause every man to find according to his ways.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,
VERSE:neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who put him in charge of the earth?
VERSE:Or who has appointed him over the whole world?
LABEL:14
VERSE:If he set his heart on himself,
VERSE:if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,
LABEL:15
VERSE:all flesh would perish together,
VERSE:and man would turn again to dust.
LABEL:16
VERSE:“If now you have understanding, hear this.
VERSE:Listen to the voice of my words.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Should even one who hates justice govern?
VERSE:Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,
LABEL:18
VERSE:who says to a king, ‘Vile!’
VERSE:or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?
LABEL:19
VERSE:He doesn’t respect the persons of princes,
VERSE:nor respect the rich more than the poor,
VERSE:for they all are the work of his hands.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In a moment they die, even at midnight.
VERSE:The people are shaken and pass away.
VERSE:The mighty are taken away without a hand.
LABEL:21
VERSE:“For his eyes are on the ways of a man.
VERSE:He sees all his goings.
LABEL:22
VERSE:There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,
VERSE:where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,
VERSE:that he should go before God in judgment.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out,
VERSE:and sets others in their place.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.
VERSE:He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He strikes them as wicked men
VERSE:in the open sight of others;
LABEL:27
VERSE:because they turned away from following him,
VERSE:and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,
LABEL:28
VERSE:so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.
VERSE:He heard the cry of the afflicted.
LABEL:29
VERSE:When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?
VERSE:When he hides his face, who then can see him?
VERSE:He is over a nation or a man alike,
LABEL:30
VERSE:that the godless man may not reign,
VERSE:that there be no one to ensnare the people.
LABEL:31
VERSE:“For has any said to God,
VERSE:‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Teach me that which I don’t see.
VERSE:If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?
LABEL:33
VERSE:Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?
VERSE:For you must choose, and not I.
VERSE:Therefore speak what you know.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Men of understanding will tell me,
VERSE:yes, every wise man who hears me:
LABEL:35
VERSE:‘Job speaks without knowledge.
VERSE:His words are without wisdom.’
LABEL:36
VERSE:I wish that Job were tried to the end,
VERSE:because of his answering like wicked men.
LABEL:37
VERSE:For he adds rebellion to his sin.
VERSE:He claps his hands among us,
VERSE:and multiplies his words against God.”
