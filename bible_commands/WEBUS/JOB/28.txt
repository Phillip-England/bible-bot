CHAPTER:28
TITLE:Job 28
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Surely there is a mine for silver,
VERSE:and a place for gold which they refine.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Iron is taken out of the earth,
VERSE:and copper is smelted out of the ore.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Man sets an end to darkness,
VERSE:and searches out, to the furthest bound,
VERSE:the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.
VERSE:They are forgotten by the foot.
VERSE:They hang far from men, they swing back and forth.
LABEL:5
VERSE:As for the earth, out of it comes bread.
VERSE:Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Sapphires come from its rocks.
VERSE:It has dust of gold.
LABEL:7
VERSE:That path no bird of prey knows,
VERSE:neither has the falcon’s eye seen it.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The proud animals have not trodden it,
VERSE:nor has the fierce lion passed by there.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He puts his hand on the flinty rock,
VERSE:and he overturns the mountains by the roots.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He cuts out channels among the rocks.
VERSE:His eye sees every precious thing.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He binds the streams that they don’t trickle.
VERSE:The thing that is hidden he brings out to light.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“But where will wisdom be found?
VERSE:Where is the place of understanding?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Man doesn’t know its price,
VERSE:and it isn’t found in the land of the living.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’
VERSE:The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’
LABEL:15
VERSE:It can’t be gotten for gold,
VERSE:neither will silver be weighed for its price.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir,
VERSE:with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Gold and glass can’t equal it,
VERSE:neither will it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
LABEL:18
VERSE:No mention will be made of coral or of crystal.
VERSE:Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The topaz of Ethiopia will not equal it.
VERSE:It won’t be valued with pure gold.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Where then does wisdom come from?
VERSE:Where is the place of understanding?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,
VERSE:and kept close from the birds of the sky.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Destruction and Death say,
VERSE:‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’
LABEL:23
VERSE:“God understands its way,
VERSE:and he knows its place.
LABEL:24
VERSE:For he looks to the ends of the earth,
VERSE:and sees under the whole sky.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He establishes the force of the wind.
VERSE:Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.
LABEL:26
VERSE:When he made a decree for the rain,
VERSE:and a way for the lightning of the thunder,
LABEL:27
VERSE:then he saw it, and declared it.
VERSE:He established it, yes, and searched it out.
LABEL:28
VERSE:To man he said,
VERSE:‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.
VERSE:To depart from evil is understanding.’”
