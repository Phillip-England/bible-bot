TITLE:Job 30
LABEL:1
VERSE:“But now those who are younger than I have me in derision,
VERSE:whose fathers I considered unworthy to put with my sheep dogs.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Of what use is the strength of their hands to me,
VERSE:men in whom ripe age has perished?
LABEL:3
VERSE:They are gaunt from lack and famine.
VERSE:They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.
VERSE:The roots of the broom tree are their food.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They are driven out from among men.
VERSE:They cry after them as after a thief,
LABEL:6
VERSE:so that they live in frightful valleys,
VERSE:and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They bray among the bushes.
VERSE:They are gathered together under the nettles.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men.
VERSE:They were flogged out of the land.
LABEL:9
VERSE:“Now I have become their song.
VERSE:Yes, I am a byword to them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,
VERSE:and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me;
VERSE:and they have thrown off restraint before me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:On my right hand rise the rabble.
VERSE:They thrust aside my feet.
VERSE:They cast their ways of destruction up against me.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They mar my path.
VERSE:They promote my destruction
VERSE:without anyone’s help.
LABEL:14
VERSE:As through a wide breach they come.
VERSE:They roll themselves in amid the ruin.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Terrors have turned on me.
VERSE:They chase my honor as the wind.
VERSE:My welfare has passed away as a cloud.
LABEL:16
VERSE:“Now my soul is poured out within me.
VERSE:Days of affliction have taken hold of me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:In the night season my bones are pierced in me,
VERSE:and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.
LABEL:18
VERSE:My garment is disfigured by great force.
VERSE:It binds me about as the collar of my tunic.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He has cast me into the mire.
VERSE:I have become like dust and ashes.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I cry to you, and you do not answer me.
VERSE:I stand up, and you gaze at me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:You have turned to be cruel to me.
VERSE:With the might of your hand you persecute me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.
VERSE:You dissolve me in the storm.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For I know that you will bring me to death,
VERSE:to the house appointed for all living.
LABEL:24
VERSE:“However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall?
VERSE:Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
LABEL:25
VERSE:Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble?
VERSE:Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?
LABEL:26
VERSE:When I looked for good, then evil came.
VERSE:When I waited for light, darkness came.
LABEL:27
VERSE:My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest.
VERSE:Days of affliction have come on me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:I go mourning without the sun.
VERSE:I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
LABEL:29
VERSE:I am a brother to jackals,
VERSE:and a companion to ostriches.
LABEL:30
VERSE:My skin grows black and peels from me.
VERSE:My bones are burned with heat.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Therefore my harp has turned to mourning,
VERSE:and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
