CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Job 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth?
VERSE:Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?
LABEL:2
VERSE:As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,
VERSE:as a hireling who looks for his wages,
LABEL:3
VERSE:so I am made to possess months of misery,
VERSE:wearisome nights are appointed to me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:When I lie down, I say,
VERSE:‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’
VERSE:I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.
LABEL:5
VERSE:My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.
VERSE:My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.
LABEL:6
VERSE:My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
VERSE:and are spent without hope.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Oh remember that my life is a breath.
VERSE:My eye will no more see good.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The eye of him who sees me will see me no more.
VERSE:Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.
LABEL:9
VERSE:As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,
VERSE:so he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He will return no more to his house,
VERSE:neither will his place know him any more.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“Therefore I will not keep silent.
VERSE:I will speak in the anguish of my spirit.
VERSE:I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Am I a sea, or a sea monster,
VERSE:that you put a guard over me?
LABEL:13
VERSE:When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me.
VERSE:My couch will ease my complaint,’
LABEL:14
VERSE:then you scare me with dreams
VERSE:and terrify me through visions,
LABEL:15
VERSE:so that my soul chooses strangling,
VERSE:death rather than my bones.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I loathe my life.
VERSE:I don’t want to live forever.
VERSE:Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.
LABEL:17
VERSE:What is man, that you should magnify him,
VERSE:that you should set your mind on him,
LABEL:18
VERSE:that you should visit him every morning,
VERSE:and test him every moment?
LABEL:19
VERSE:How long will you not look away from me,
VERSE:nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?
LABEL:20
VERSE:If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?
VERSE:Why have you set me as a mark for you,
VERSE:so that I am a burden to myself?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?
VERSE:For now will I lie down in the dust.
VERSE:You will seek me diligently, but I will not be.”
