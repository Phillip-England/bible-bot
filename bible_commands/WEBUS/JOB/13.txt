TITLE:Job 13
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Behold, my eye has seen all this.
VERSE:My ear has heard and understood it.
LABEL:2
VERSE:What you know, I know also.
VERSE:I am not inferior to you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:“Surely I would speak to the Almighty.
VERSE:I desire to reason with God.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But you are forgers of lies.
VERSE:You are all physicians of no value.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Oh that you would be completely silent!
VERSE:Then you would be wise.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Hear now my reasoning.
VERSE:Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Will you speak unrighteously for God,
VERSE:and talk deceitfully for him?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Will you show partiality to him?
VERSE:Will you contend for God?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Is it good that he should search you out?
VERSE:Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:He will surely reprove you
VERSE:if you secretly show partiality.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Won’t his majesty make you afraid
VERSE:and his dread fall on you?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes.
VERSE:Your defenses are defenses of clay.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“Be silent!
VERSE:Leave me alone, that I may speak.
VERSE:Let come on me what will.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Why should I take my flesh in my teeth,
VERSE:and put my life in my hand?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, he will kill me.
VERSE:I have no hope.
VERSE:Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him.
LABEL:16
VERSE:This also will be my salvation,
VERSE:that a godless man will not come before him.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Listen carefully to my speech.
VERSE:Let my declaration be in your ears.
LABEL:18
VERSE:See now, I have set my cause in order.
VERSE:I know that I am righteous.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Who is he who will contend with me?
VERSE:For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“Only don’t do two things to me,
VERSE:then I will not hide myself from your face:
LABEL:21
VERSE:withdraw your hand far from me,
VERSE:and don’t let your terror make me afraid.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Then call, and I will answer,
VERSE:or let me speak, and you answer me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:How many are my iniquities and sins?
VERSE:Make me know my disobedience and my sin.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Why do you hide your face,
VERSE:and consider me your enemy?
LABEL:25
VERSE:Will you harass a driven leaf?
VERSE:Will you pursue the dry stubble?
LABEL:26
VERSE:For you write bitter things against me,
VERSE:and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
LABEL:27
VERSE:You also put my feet in the stocks,
VERSE:and mark all my paths.
VERSE:You set a bound to the soles of my feet,
LABEL:28
VERSE:though I am decaying like a rotten thing,
VERSE:like a garment that is moth-eaten.
