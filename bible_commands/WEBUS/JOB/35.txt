TITLE:Job 35
LABEL:1
VERSE:Moreover Elihu answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Do you think this to be your right,
VERSE:or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’
LABEL:3
VERSE:that you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you?
VERSE:What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will answer you,
VERSE:and your companions with you.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Look to the skies, and see.
VERSE:See the skies, which are higher than you.
LABEL:6
VERSE:If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?
VERSE:If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
LABEL:7
VERSE:If you are righteous, what do you give him?
VERSE:Or what does he receive from your hand?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,
VERSE:and your righteousness may profit a son of man.
LABEL:9
VERSE:“By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.
VERSE:They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
VERSE:who gives songs in the night,
LABEL:11
VERSE:who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,
VERSE:and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
LABEL:12
VERSE:There they cry, but no one answers,
VERSE:because of the pride of evil men.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Surely God will not hear an empty cry,
VERSE:neither will the Almighty regard it.
LABEL:14
VERSE:How much less when you say you don’t see him.
VERSE:The cause is before him, and you wait for him!
LABEL:15
VERSE:But now, because he has not visited in his anger,
VERSE:neither does he greatly regard arrogance,
LABEL:16
VERSE:therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,
VERSE:and he multiplies words without knowledge.”
