TITLE:Job 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“How long will you speak these things?
VERSE:Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Does God pervert justice?
VERSE:Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
LABEL:4
VERSE:If your children have sinned against him,
VERSE:he has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.
LABEL:5
VERSE:If you want to seek God diligently,
VERSE:make your supplication to the Almighty.
LABEL:6
VERSE:If you were pure and upright,
VERSE:surely now he would awaken for you,
VERSE:and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Though your beginning was small,
VERSE:yet your latter end would greatly increase.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“Please inquire of past generations.
VERSE:Find out about the learning of their fathers.
LABEL:9
VERSE:(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
VERSE:because our days on earth are a shadow.)
LABEL:10
VERSE:Shall they not teach you, tell you,
VERSE:and utter words out of their heart?
LABEL:11
VERSE:“Can the papyrus grow up without mire?
VERSE:Can the rushes grow without water?
LABEL:12
VERSE:While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down,
VERSE:it withers before any other reed.
LABEL:13
VERSE:So are the paths of all who forget God.
VERSE:The hope of the godless man will perish,
LABEL:14
VERSE:whose confidence will break apart,
VERSE:whose trust is a spider’s web.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He will lean on his house, but it will not stand.
VERSE:He will cling to it, but it will not endure.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He is green before the sun.
VERSE:His shoots go out along his garden.
LABEL:17
VERSE:His roots are wrapped around the rock pile.
VERSE:He sees the place of stones.
LABEL:18
VERSE:If he is destroyed from his place,
VERSE:then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’
LABEL:19
VERSE:Behold, this is the joy of his way.
VERSE:Out of the earth, others will spring.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man,
VERSE:neither will he uphold the evildoers.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He will still fill your mouth with laughter,
VERSE:your lips with shouting.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Those who hate you will be clothed with shame.
VERSE:The tent of the wicked will be no more.”
