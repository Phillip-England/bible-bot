TITLE:Job 36
LABEL:1
VERSE:Elihu also continued, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Bear with me a little, and I will show you;
VERSE:for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I will get my knowledge from afar,
VERSE:and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For truly my words are not false.
VERSE:One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
LABEL:5
VERSE:“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone.
VERSE:He is mighty in strength of understanding.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked,
VERSE:but gives justice to the afflicted.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,
VERSE:but with kings on the throne,
VERSE:he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
LABEL:8
VERSE:If they are bound in fetters,
VERSE:and are taken in the cords of afflictions,
LABEL:9
VERSE:then he shows them their work,
VERSE:and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He also opens their ears to instruction,
VERSE:and commands that they return from iniquity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If they listen and serve him,
VERSE:they will spend their days in prosperity,
VERSE:and their years in pleasures.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword;
VERSE:they will die without knowledge.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.
VERSE:They don’t cry for help when he binds them.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They die in youth.
VERSE:Their life perishes among the unclean.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,
VERSE:and opens their ear in oppression.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,
VERSE:into a wide place, where there is no restriction.
VERSE:That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.
VERSE:Judgment and justice take hold of you.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Don’t let riches entice you to wrath,
VERSE:neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Would your wealth sustain you in distress,
VERSE:or all the might of your strength?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Don’t desire the night,
VERSE:when people are cut off in their place.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Take heed, don’t regard iniquity;
VERSE:for you have chosen this rather than affliction.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Behold, God is exalted in his power.
VERSE:Who is a teacher like him?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Who has prescribed his way for him?
VERSE:Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness’?
LABEL:24
VERSE:“Remember that you magnify his work,
VERSE:about which men have sung.
LABEL:25
VERSE:All men have looked on it.
VERSE:Man sees it afar off.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him.
VERSE:The number of his years is unsearchable.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For he draws up the drops of water,
VERSE:which distill in rain from his vapor,
LABEL:28
VERSE:which the skies pour down
VERSE:and which drop on man abundantly.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds
VERSE:and the thunderings of his pavilion?
LABEL:30
VERSE:Behold, he spreads his light around him.
VERSE:He covers the bottom of the sea.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For by these he judges the people.
VERSE:He gives food in abundance.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He covers his hands with the lightning,
VERSE:and commands it to strike the mark.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Its noise tells about him,
VERSE:and the livestock also, concerning the storm that comes up.
