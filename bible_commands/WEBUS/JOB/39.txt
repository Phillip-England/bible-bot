TITLE:Job 39
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?
VERSE:Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Can you count the months that they fulfill?
VERSE:Or do you know the time when they give birth?
LABEL:3
VERSE:They bow themselves. They bear their young.
VERSE:They end their labor pains.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Their young ones become strong.
VERSE:They grow up in the open field.
VERSE:They go out, and don’t return again.
LABEL:5
VERSE:“Who has set the wild donkey free?
VERSE:Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,
LABEL:6
VERSE:whose home I have made the wilderness,
VERSE:and the salt land his dwelling place?
LABEL:7
VERSE:He scorns the tumult of the city,
VERSE:neither does he hear the shouting of the driver.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The range of the mountains is his pasture.
VERSE:He searches after every green thing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:“Will the wild ox be content to serve you?
VERSE:Or will he stay by your feeding trough?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?
VERSE:Or will he till the valleys after you?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Will you trust him, because his strength is great?
VERSE:Or will you leave to him your labor?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,
VERSE:and gather the grain of your threshing floor?
LABEL:13
VERSE:“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly,
VERSE:but are they the feathers and plumage of love?
LABEL:14
VERSE:For she leaves her eggs on the earth,
VERSE:warms them in the dust,
LABEL:15
VERSE:and forgets that the foot may crush them,
VERSE:or that the wild animal may trample them.
LABEL:16
VERSE:She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers.
VERSE:Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,
LABEL:17
VERSE:because God has deprived her of wisdom,
VERSE:neither has he imparted to her understanding.
LABEL:18
VERSE:When she lifts up herself on high,
VERSE:she scorns the horse and his rider.
LABEL:19
VERSE:“Have you given the horse might?
VERSE:Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Have you made him to leap as a locust?
VERSE:The glory of his snorting is awesome.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength.
VERSE:He goes out to meet the armed men.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,
VERSE:neither does he turn back from the sword.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The quiver rattles against him,
VERSE:the flashing spear and the javelin.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,
VERSE:neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
LABEL:25
VERSE:As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’
VERSE:He smells the battle afar off,
VERSE:the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
LABEL:26
VERSE:“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,
VERSE:and stretches her wings toward the south?
LABEL:27
VERSE:Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,
VERSE:and makes his nest on high?
LABEL:28
VERSE:On the cliff he dwells and makes his home,
VERSE:on the point of the cliff and the stronghold.
LABEL:29
VERSE:From there he spies out the prey.
VERSE:His eyes see it afar off.
LABEL:30
VERSE:His young ones also suck up blood.
VERSE:Where the slain are, there he is.”
