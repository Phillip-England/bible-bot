VERSE:Why are we counted as animals,

VERSE:Terrors will make him afraid on every side,
VERSE:and will chase him at his heels.
LABEL:12
VERSE:His strength will be famished.

VERSE:His roots will be dried up beneath.
VERSE:His branch will be cut off above.

VERSE:This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”
