TITLE:Job 24
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Why aren’t times laid up by the Almighty?
VERSE:Why don’t those who know him see his days?
LABEL:2
VERSE:There are people who remove the landmarks.
VERSE:They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,
VERSE:and they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They turn the needy out of the way.
VERSE:The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,
VERSE:they go out to their work, seeking diligently for food.
VERSE:The wilderness yields them bread for their children.
LABEL:6
VERSE:They cut their food in the field.
VERSE:They glean the vineyard of the wicked.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They lie all night naked without clothing,
VERSE:and have no covering in the cold.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
VERSE:and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.
LABEL:9
VERSE:There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,
VERSE:and take a pledge of the poor,
LABEL:10
VERSE:so that they go around naked without clothing.
VERSE:Being hungry, they carry the sheaves.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They make oil within the walls of these men.
VERSE:They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst.
LABEL:12
VERSE:From out of the populous city, men groan.
VERSE:The soul of the wounded cries out,
VERSE:yet God doesn’t regard the folly.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“These are of those who rebel against the light.
VERSE:They don’t know its ways,
VERSE:nor stay in its paths.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The murderer rises with the light.
VERSE:He kills the poor and needy.
VERSE:In the night he is like a thief.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight,
VERSE:saying, ‘No eye will see me.’
VERSE:He disguises his face.
LABEL:16
VERSE:In the dark they dig through houses.
VERSE:They shut themselves up in the daytime.
VERSE:They don’t know the light.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,
VERSE:for they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
LABEL:18
VERSE:“They are foam on the surface of the waters.
VERSE:Their portion is cursed in the earth.
VERSE:They don’t turn into the way of the vineyards.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Drought and heat consume the snow waters,
VERSE:so does Sheol those who have sinned.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The womb will forget him.
VERSE:The worm will feed sweetly on him.
VERSE:He will be no more remembered.
VERSE:Unrighteousness will be broken as a tree.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He devours the barren who don’t bear.
VERSE:He shows no kindness to the widow.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yet God preserves the mighty by his power.
VERSE:He rises up who has no assurance of life.
LABEL:23
VERSE:God gives them security, and they rest in it.
VERSE:His eyes are on their ways.
LABEL:24
VERSE:They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone.
VERSE:Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,
VERSE:and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
LABEL:25
VERSE:If it isn’t so now, who will prove me a liar,
VERSE:and make my speech worth nothing?”
