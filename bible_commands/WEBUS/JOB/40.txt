VERSE:Moreover Yahweh answered Job,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?
VERSE:He who argues with God, let him answer it.”
LABEL:3
VERSE:Then Job answered Yahweh,
LABEL:4
VERSE:“Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you?
VERSE:I lay my hand on my mouth.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I have spoken once, and I will not answer;
VERSE:Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind:
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Now brace yourself like a man.
VERSE:I will question you, and you will answer me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Will you even annul my judgment?
VERSE:Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?

VERSE:Or do you have an arm like God?
VERSE:Can you thunder with a voice like him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.
VERSE:Array yourself with honor and majesty.

VERSE:Pour out the fury of your anger.

VERSE:Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him.
VERSE:Crush the wicked in their place.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Hide them in the dust together.
VERSE:Bind their faces in the hidden place.

VERSE:Then I will also admit to you
VERSE:that your own right hand can save you.

VERSE:“See now behemoth, which I made as well as you.
VERSE:He eats grass as an ox.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Look now, his strength is in his thighs.
VERSE:His force is in the muscles of his belly.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He moves his tail like a cedar.
VERSE:The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
LABEL:18
VERSE:His bones are like tubes of bronze.
VERSE:His limbs are like bars of iron.

VERSE:He is the chief of the ways of God.
VERSE:He who made him gives him his sword.

VERSE:Surely the mountains produce food for him,
VERSE:where all the animals of the field play.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He lies under the lotus trees,
VERSE:in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The lotuses cover him with their shade.
VERSE:The willows of the brook surround him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble.
VERSE:He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Shall any take him when he is on the watch,
VERSE:or pierce through his nose with a snare?
