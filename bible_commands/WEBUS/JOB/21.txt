TITLE:Job 21
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Listen diligently to my speech.
VERSE:Let this be your consolation.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Allow me, and I also will speak.
VERSE:After I have spoken, mock on.
LABEL:4
VERSE:As for me, is my complaint to man?
VERSE:Why shouldn’t I be impatient?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Look at me, and be astonished.
VERSE:Lay your hand on your mouth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:When I remember, I am troubled.
VERSE:Horror takes hold of my flesh.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Why do the wicked live,
VERSE:become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Their child is established with them in their sight,
VERSE:their offspring before their eyes.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Their houses are safe from fear,
VERSE:neither is the rod of God upon them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Their bulls breed without fail.
VERSE:Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They send out their little ones like a flock.
VERSE:Their children dance.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They sing to the tambourine and harp,
VERSE:and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They spend their days in prosperity.
VERSE:In an instant they go down to Sheol.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They tell God, ‘Depart from us,
VERSE:for we don’t want to know about your ways.
LABEL:15
VERSE:What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
VERSE:What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’
LABEL:16
VERSE:Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand.
VERSE:The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,
VERSE:that their calamity comes on them,
VERSE:that God distributes sorrows in his anger?
LABEL:18
VERSE:How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,
VERSE:as chaff that the storm carries away?
LABEL:19
VERSE:You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’
VERSE:Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Let his own eyes see his destruction.
VERSE:Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For what does he care for his house after him,
VERSE:when the number of his months is cut off?
LABEL:22
VERSE:“Shall any teach God knowledge,
VERSE:since he judges those who are high?
LABEL:23
VERSE:One dies in his full strength,
VERSE:being wholly at ease and quiet.
LABEL:24
VERSE:His pails are full of milk.
VERSE:The marrow of his bones is moistened.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Another dies in bitterness of soul,
VERSE:and never tastes of good.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They lie down alike in the dust.
VERSE:The worm covers them.
LABEL:27
VERSE:“Behold, I know your thoughts,
VERSE:the plans with which you would wrong me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince?
VERSE:Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’
LABEL:29
VERSE:Haven’t you asked wayfaring men?
VERSE:Don’t you know their evidences,
LABEL:30
VERSE:that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity,
VERSE:that they are led out to the day of wrath?
LABEL:31
VERSE:Who will declare his way to his face?
VERSE:Who will repay him what he has done?
LABEL:32
VERSE:Yet he will be borne to the grave.
VERSE:Men will keep watch over the tomb.
LABEL:33
VERSE:The clods of the valley will be sweet to him.
VERSE:All men will draw after him,
VERSE:as there were innumerable before him.
LABEL:34
VERSE:So how can you comfort me with nonsense,
VERSE:because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”
