TITLE:Job 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:“My soul is weary of my life.
VERSE:I will give free course to my complaint.
VERSE:I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me.
VERSE:Show me why you contend with me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Is it good to you that you should oppress,
VERSE:that you should despise the work of your hands,
VERSE:and smile on the counsel of the wicked?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Do you have eyes of flesh?
VERSE:Or do you see as man sees?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Are your days as the days of mortals,
VERSE:or your years as man’s years,
LABEL:6
VERSE:that you inquire after my iniquity,
VERSE:and search after my sin?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Although you know that I am not wicked,
VERSE:there is no one who can deliver out of your hand.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether,
VERSE:yet you destroy me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay.
VERSE:Will you bring me into dust again?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Haven’t you poured me out like milk,
VERSE:and curdled me like cheese?
LABEL:11
VERSE:You have clothed me with skin and flesh,
VERSE:and knit me together with bones and sinews.
LABEL:12
VERSE:You have granted me life and loving kindness.
VERSE:Your visitation has preserved my spirit.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yet you hid these things in your heart.
VERSE:I know that this is with you:
LABEL:14
VERSE:if I sin, then you mark me.
VERSE:You will not acquit me from my iniquity.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If I am wicked, woe to me.
VERSE:If I am righteous, I still will not lift up my head,
VERSE:being filled with disgrace,
VERSE:and conscious of my affliction.
LABEL:16
VERSE:If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion.
VERSE:Again you show yourself powerful to me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:You renew your witnesses against me,
VERSE:and increase your indignation on me.
VERSE:Changes and warfare are with me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:“‘Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb?
VERSE:I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I should have been as though I had not been.
VERSE:I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Aren’t my days few?
VERSE:Stop!
VERSE:Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,
LABEL:21
VERSE:before I go where I will not return from,
VERSE:to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
LABEL:22
VERSE:the land dark as midnight,
VERSE:of the shadow of death,
VERSE:without any order,
VERSE:where the light is as midnight.’”
