TITLE:Job 37
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Yes, at this my heart trembles,
VERSE:and is moved out of its place.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,
VERSE:the sound that goes out of his mouth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He sends it out under the whole sky,
VERSE:and his lightning to the ends of the earth.
LABEL:4
VERSE:After it a voice roars.
VERSE:He thunders with the voice of his majesty.
VERSE:He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard.
LABEL:5
VERSE:God thunders marvelously with his voice.
VERSE:He does great things, which we can’t comprehend.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’
VERSE:likewise to the shower of rain,
VERSE:and to the showers of his mighty rain.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He seals up the hand of every man,
VERSE:that all men whom he has made may know it.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Then the animals take cover,
VERSE:and remain in their dens.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Out of its room comes the storm,
VERSE:and cold out of the north.
LABEL:10
VERSE:By the breath of God, ice is given,
VERSE:and the width of the waters is frozen.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.
VERSE:He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.
LABEL:12
VERSE:It is turned around by his guidance,
VERSE:that they may do whatever he commands them
VERSE:on the surface of the habitable world,
LABEL:13
VERSE:whether it is for correction, or for his land,
VERSE:or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come.
LABEL:14
VERSE:“Listen to this, Job.
VERSE:Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Do you know how God controls them,
VERSE:and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Do you know the workings of the clouds,
VERSE:the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
LABEL:17
VERSE:You whose clothing is warm
VERSE:when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Can you, with him, spread out the sky,
VERSE:which is strong as a cast metal mirror?
LABEL:19
VERSE:Teach us what we will tell him,
VERSE:for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Will it be told him that I would speak?
VERSE:Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies,
VERSE:but the wind passes, and clears them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Out of the north comes golden splendor.
VERSE:With God is awesome majesty.
LABEL:23
VERSE:We can’t reach the Almighty.
VERSE:He is exalted in power.
VERSE:In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Therefore men revere him.
VERSE:He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”
