TITLE:Job 17
LABEL:1
VERSE:“My spirit is consumed.
VERSE:My days are extinct
VERSE:and the grave is ready for me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Surely there are mockers with me.
VERSE:My eye dwells on their provocation.
LABEL:3
VERSE:“Now give a pledge. Be collateral for me with yourself.
VERSE:Who is there who will strike hands with me?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For you have hidden their heart from understanding,
VERSE:therefore you will not exalt them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:He who denounces his friends for plunder,
VERSE:even the eyes of his children will fail.
LABEL:6
VERSE:“But he has made me a byword of the people.
VERSE:They spit in my face.
LABEL:7
VERSE:My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.
VERSE:All my members are as a shadow.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Upright men will be astonished at this.
VERSE:The innocent will stir himself up against the godless.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Yet the righteous will hold to his way.
VERSE:He who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But as for you all, come back.
VERSE:I will not find a wise man among you.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My days are past.
VERSE:My plans are broken off,
VERSE:as are the thoughts of my heart.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They change the night into day,
VERSE:saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If I look for Sheol as my house,
VERSE:if I have spread my couch in the darkness,
LABEL:14
VERSE:if I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father,’
VERSE:and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘My sister,’
LABEL:15
VERSE:where then is my hope?
VERSE:As for my hope, who will see it?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol,
VERSE:or descend together into the dust?”
