TITLE:Job 16
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“I have heard many such things.
VERSE:You are all miserable comforters!
LABEL:3
VERSE:Shall vain words have an end?
VERSE:Or what provokes you that you answer?
LABEL:4
VERSE:I also could speak as you do.
VERSE:If your soul were in my soul’s place,
VERSE:I could join words together against you,
VERSE:and shake my head at you,
LABEL:5
VERSE:but I would strengthen you with my mouth.
VERSE:The solace of my lips would relieve you.
LABEL:6
VERSE:“Though I speak, my grief is not subsided.
VERSE:Though I forbear, what am I eased?
LABEL:7
VERSE:But now, God, you have surely worn me out.
VERSE:You have made all my company desolate.
LABEL:8
VERSE:You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me.
VERSE:My leanness rises up against me.
VERSE:It testifies to my face.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He has torn me in his wrath and persecuted me.
VERSE:He has gnashed on me with his teeth.
VERSE:My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They have gaped on me with their mouth.
VERSE:They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully.
VERSE:They gather themselves together against me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:God delivers me to the ungodly,
VERSE:and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I was at ease, and he broke me apart.
VERSE:Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces.
VERSE:He has also set me up for his target.
LABEL:13
VERSE:His archers surround me.
VERSE:He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare.
VERSE:He pours out my bile on the ground.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He breaks me with breach on breach.
VERSE:He runs at me like a giant.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,
VERSE:and have thrust my horn in the dust.
LABEL:16
VERSE:My face is red with weeping.
VERSE:Deep darkness is on my eyelids,
LABEL:17
VERSE:although there is no violence in my hands,
VERSE:and my prayer is pure.
LABEL:18
VERSE:“Earth, don’t cover my blood.
VERSE:Let my cry have no place to rest.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.
VERSE:He who vouches for me is on high.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My friends scoff at me.
VERSE:My eyes pour out tears to God,
LABEL:21
VERSE:that he would maintain the right of a man with God,
VERSE:of a son of man with his neighbor!
LABEL:22
VERSE:For when a few years have come,
VERSE:I will go the way of no return.
