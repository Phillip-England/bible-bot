CHAPTER:31
TITLE:Job 31
LABEL:1
VERSE:“I made a covenant with my eyes;
VERSE:how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?
LABEL:2
VERSE:For what is the portion from God above,
VERSE:and the heritage from the Almighty on high?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
VERSE:and disaster to the workers of iniquity?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Doesn’t he see my ways,
VERSE:and count all my steps?
LABEL:5
VERSE:“If I have walked with falsehood,
VERSE:and my foot has hurried to deceit
LABEL:6
VERSE:(let me be weighed in an even balance,
VERSE:that God may know my integrity);
LABEL:7
VERSE:if my step has turned out of the way,
VERSE:if my heart walked after my eyes,
VERSE:if any defilement has stuck to my hands,
LABEL:8
VERSE:then let me sow, and let another eat.
VERSE:Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.
LABEL:9
VERSE:“If my heart has been enticed to a woman,
VERSE:and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door,
LABEL:10
VERSE:then let my wife grind for another,
VERSE:and let others sleep with her.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For that would be a heinous crime.
VERSE:Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,
LABEL:12
VERSE:for it is a fire that consumes to destruction,
VERSE:and would root out all my increase.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“If I have despised the cause of my male servant
VERSE:or of my female servant,
VERSE:when they contended with me,
LABEL:14
VERSE:what then will I do when God rises up?
VERSE:When he visits, what will I answer him?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him?
VERSE:Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?
LABEL:16
VERSE:“If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
VERSE:or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
LABEL:17
VERSE:or have eaten my morsel alone,
VERSE:and the fatherless has not eaten of it
LABEL:18
VERSE:(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
VERSE:I have guided her from my mother’s womb);
LABEL:19
VERSE:if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
VERSE:or that the needy had no covering;
LABEL:20
VERSE:if his heart hasn’t blessed me,
VERSE:if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;
LABEL:21
VERSE:if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
VERSE:because I saw my help in the gate;
LABEL:22
VERSE:then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,
VERSE:and my arm be broken from the bone.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For calamity from God is a terror to me.
VERSE:Because of his majesty, I can do nothing.
LABEL:24
VERSE:“If I have made gold my hope,
VERSE:and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’
LABEL:25
VERSE:If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,
VERSE:and because my hand had gotten much;
LABEL:26
VERSE:if I have seen the sun when it shined,
VERSE:or the moon moving in splendor,
LABEL:27
VERSE:and my heart has been secretly enticed,
VERSE:and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth;
LABEL:28
VERSE:this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,
VERSE:for I would have denied the God who is above.
LABEL:29
VERSE:“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,
VERSE:or lifted up myself when evil found him
LABEL:30
VERSE:(I have certainly not allowed my mouth to sin
VERSE:by asking his life with a curse);
LABEL:31
VERSE:if the men of my tent have not said,
VERSE:‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’
LABEL:32
VERSE:(the foreigner has not camped in the street,
VERSE:but I have opened my doors to the traveler);
LABEL:33
VERSE:if like Adam I have covered my transgressions,
VERSE:by hiding my iniquity in my heart,
LABEL:34
VERSE:because I feared the great multitude,
VERSE:and the contempt of families terrified me,
VERSE:so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door—
LABEL:35
VERSE:oh that I had one to hear me!
VERSE:Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!
VERSE:Let the accuser write my indictment!
LABEL:36
VERSE:Surely I would carry it on my shoulder,
VERSE:and I would bind it to me as a crown.
LABEL:37
VERSE:I would declare to him the number of my steps.
VERSE:I would go near to him like a prince.
LABEL:38
VERSE:If my land cries out against me,
VERSE:and its furrows weep together;
LABEL:39
VERSE:if I have eaten its fruits without money,
VERSE:or have caused its owners to lose their life,
LABEL:40
VERSE:let briers grow instead of wheat,
VERSE:and stinkweed instead of barley.”
VERSE:The words of Job are ended.
