TITLE:Job 33
LABEL:1
VERSE:“However, Job, please hear my speech,
VERSE:and listen to all my words.
LABEL:2
VERSE:See now, I have opened my mouth.
VERSE:My tongue has spoken in my mouth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:My words will utter the uprightness of my heart.
VERSE:That which my lips know they will speak sincerely.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The Spirit of God has made me,
VERSE:and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
LABEL:5
VERSE:If you can, answer me.
VERSE:Set your words in order before me, and stand up.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Behold, I am toward God even as you are.
VERSE:I am also formed out of the clay.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, my terror will not make you afraid,
VERSE:neither will my pressure be heavy on you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
VERSE:I have heard the voice of your words, saying,
LABEL:9
VERSE:‘I am clean, without disobedience.
VERSE:I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Behold, he finds occasions against me.
VERSE:He counts me for his enemy.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He puts my feet in the stocks.
VERSE:He marks all my paths.’
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just,
VERSE:for God is greater than man.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Why do you strive against him,
VERSE:because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?
LABEL:14
VERSE:For God speaks once,
VERSE:yes twice, though man pays no attention.
LABEL:15
VERSE:In a dream, in a vision of the night,
VERSE:when deep sleep falls on men,
VERSE:in slumbering on the bed,
LABEL:16
VERSE:then he opens the ears of men,
VERSE:and seals their instruction,
LABEL:17
VERSE:that he may withdraw man from his purpose,
VERSE:and hide pride from man.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He keeps back his soul from the pit,
VERSE:and his life from perishing by the sword.
LABEL:19
VERSE:“He is chastened also with pain on his bed,
VERSE:with continual strife in his bones,
LABEL:20
VERSE:so that his life abhors bread,
VERSE:and his soul dainty food.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen.
VERSE:His bones that were not seen stick out.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,
VERSE:and his life to the destroyers.
LABEL:23
VERSE:“If there is beside him an angel,
VERSE:an interpreter, one among a thousand,
VERSE:to show to man what is right for him,
LABEL:24
VERSE:then God is gracious to him, and says,
VERSE:‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,
VERSE:I have found a ransom.’
LABEL:25
VERSE:His flesh will be fresher than a child’s.
VERSE:He returns to the days of his youth.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,
VERSE:so that he sees his face with joy.
VERSE:He restores to man his righteousness.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He sings before men, and says,
VERSE:‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
VERSE:and it didn’t profit me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.
VERSE:My life will see the light.’
LABEL:29
VERSE:“Behold, God does all these things,
VERSE:twice, yes three times, with a man,
LABEL:30
VERSE:to bring back his soul from the pit,
VERSE:that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Mark well, Job, and listen to me.
VERSE:Hold your peace, and I will speak.
LABEL:32
VERSE:If you have anything to say, answer me.
VERSE:Speak, for I desire to justify you.
LABEL:33
VERSE:If not, listen to me.
VERSE:Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”
