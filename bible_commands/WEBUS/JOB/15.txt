CHAPTER:15
TITLE:Job 15
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge,
VERSE:and fill himself with the east wind?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
VERSE:or with speeches with which he can do no good?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Yes, you do away with fear,
VERSE:and hinder devotion before God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
VERSE:and you choose the language of the crafty.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Your own mouth condemns you, and not I.
VERSE:Yes, your own lips testify against you.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Are you the first man who was born?
VERSE:Or were you brought out before the hills?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Have you heard the secret counsel of God?
VERSE:Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
LABEL:9
VERSE:What do you know that we don’t know?
VERSE:What do you understand which is not in us?
LABEL:10
VERSE:With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,
VERSE:much older than your father.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Are the consolations of God too small for you,
VERSE:even the word that is gentle toward you?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why does your heart carry you away?
VERSE:Why do your eyes flash,
LABEL:13
VERSE:that you turn your spirit against God,
VERSE:and let such words go out of your mouth?
LABEL:14
VERSE:What is man, that he should be clean?
VERSE:What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones.
VERSE:Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;
LABEL:16
VERSE:how much less one who is abominable and corrupt,
VERSE:a man who drinks iniquity like water!
LABEL:17
VERSE:“I will show you, listen to me;
VERSE:that which I have seen I will declare
LABEL:18
VERSE:(which wise men have told by their fathers,
VERSE:and have not hidden it;
LABEL:19
VERSE:to whom alone the land was given,
VERSE:and no stranger passed among them):
LABEL:20
VERSE:the wicked man writhes in pain all his days,
VERSE:even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
LABEL:21
VERSE:A sound of terrors is in his ears.
VERSE:In prosperity the destroyer will come on him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He doesn’t believe that he will return out of darkness.
VERSE:He is waited for by the sword.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’
VERSE:He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Distress and anguish make him afraid.
VERSE:They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Because he has stretched out his hand against God,
VERSE:and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,
LABEL:26
VERSE:he runs at him with a stiff neck,
VERSE:with the thick shields of his bucklers,
LABEL:27
VERSE:because he has covered his face with his fatness,
VERSE:and gathered fat on his thighs.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He has lived in desolate cities,
VERSE:in houses which no one inhabited,
VERSE:which were ready to become heaps.
LABEL:29
VERSE:He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue,
VERSE:neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He will not depart out of darkness.
VERSE:The flame will dry up his branches.
VERSE:He will go away by the breath of God’s mouth.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself,
VERSE:for emptiness will be his reward.
LABEL:32
VERSE:It will be accomplished before his time.
VERSE:His branch will not be green.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
VERSE:and will cast off his flower as the olive tree.
LABEL:34
VERSE:For the company of the godless will be barren,
VERSE:and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
LABEL:35
VERSE:They conceive mischief and produce iniquity.
VERSE:Their heart prepares deceit.”
