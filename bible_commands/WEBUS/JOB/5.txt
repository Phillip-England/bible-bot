CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Job 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Call now; is there any who will answer you?
VERSE:To which of the holy ones will you turn?
LABEL:2
VERSE:For resentment kills the foolish man,
VERSE:and jealousy kills the simple.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have seen the foolish taking root,
VERSE:but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
LABEL:4
VERSE:His children are far from safety.
VERSE:They are crushed in the gate.
VERSE:Neither is there any to deliver them,
LABEL:5
VERSE:whose harvest the hungry eat up,
VERSE:and take it even out of the thorns.
VERSE:The snare gapes for their substance.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,
VERSE:neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
LABEL:7
VERSE:but man is born to trouble,
VERSE:as the sparks fly upward.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“But as for me, I would seek God.
VERSE:I would commit my cause to God,
LABEL:9
VERSE:who does great things that can’t be fathomed,
VERSE:marvelous things without number;
LABEL:10
VERSE:who gives rain on the earth,
VERSE:and sends waters on the fields;
LABEL:11
VERSE:so that he sets up on high those who are low,
VERSE:those who mourn are exalted to safety.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He frustrates the plans of the crafty,
VERSE:so that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He takes the wise in their own craftiness;
VERSE:the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They meet with darkness in the day time,
VERSE:and grope at noonday as in the night.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But he saves from the sword of their mouth,
VERSE:even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
LABEL:16
VERSE:So the poor has hope,
VERSE:and injustice shuts her mouth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.
VERSE:Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For he wounds and binds up.
VERSE:He injures and his hands make whole.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He will deliver you in six troubles;
VERSE:yes, in seven no evil will touch you.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In famine he will redeem you from death;
VERSE:in war, from the power of the sword.
LABEL:21
VERSE:You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
VERSE:neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
LABEL:22
VERSE:You will laugh at destruction and famine,
VERSE:neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For you will be allied with the stones of the field.
VERSE:The animals of the field will be at peace with you.
LABEL:24
VERSE:You will know that your tent is in peace.
VERSE:You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing.
LABEL:25
VERSE:You will know also that your offspring will be great,
VERSE:your offspring as the grass of the earth.
LABEL:26
VERSE:You will come to your grave in a full age,
VERSE:like a shock of grain comes in its season.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Behold, we have researched it. It is so.
VERSE:Hear it, and know it for your good.”
