VERSE:Do two walk together,

VERSE:Will a lion roar in the thicket,
VERSE:when he has no prey?
VERSE:Does a young lion cry out of his den,
VERSE:if he has caught nothing?

VERSE:Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth,
VERSE:where no snare is set for him?
VERSE:Does a snare spring up from the ground,
VERSE:when there is nothing to catch?

VERSE:Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city,
VERSE:without the people being afraid?
VERSE:Does evil happen to a city,

VERSE:Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing,
VERSE:unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.

VERSE:Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,
VERSE:and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,
VERSE:and say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,
VERSE:and see what unrest is in her,
VERSE:and what oppression is among them.”

VERSE:“Indeed they don’t know to do right,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces.”

VERSE:and your fortresses will be plundered.”

VERSE:Yahweh says:
VERSE:“As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs,

VERSE:so shall the children of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch,
VERSE:and on the silken cushions of a bed.”

VERSE:and fall to the ground.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I will strike the winter house with the summer house;
VERSE:and the houses of ivory will perish,
VERSE:and the great houses will have an end,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
