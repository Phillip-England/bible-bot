CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Amos 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel:
LABEL:2
VERSE:“The virgin of Israel has fallen;
VERSE:She shall rise no more.
VERSE:She is cast down on her land;
VERSE:there is no one to raise her up.”
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the Lord Yahweh says:
VERSE:“The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left,
VERSE:and that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:For Yahweh says to the house of Israel:
VERSE:“Seek me, and you will live;
LABEL:5
VERSE:but don’t seek Bethel,
VERSE:nor enter into Gilgal,
VERSE:and don’t pass to Beersheba;
VERSE:for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,
VERSE:and Bethel shall come to nothing.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Seek Yahweh, and you will live,
VERSE:lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
VERSE:and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel.
LABEL:7
VERSE:You who turn justice to wormwood,
VERSE:and cast down righteousness to the earth!
LABEL:8
VERSE:Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion,
VERSE:and turns the shadow of death into the morning,
VERSE:and makes the day dark with night;
VERSE:who calls for the waters of the sea,
VERSE:and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name,
LABEL:9
VERSE:who brings sudden destruction on the strong,
VERSE:so that destruction comes on the fortress.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They hate him who reproves in the gate,
VERSE:and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Therefore, because you trample on the poor and take taxes from him of wheat,
VERSE:you have built houses of cut stone, but you will not dwell in them.
VERSE:You have planted pleasant vineyards,
VERSE:but you shall not drink their wine.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For I know how many are your offenses,
VERSE:and how great are your sins—
VERSE:you who afflict the just,
VERSE:who take a bribe,
VERSE:and who turn away the needy in the courts.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,
VERSE:for it is an evil time.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Seek good, and not evil,
VERSE:that you may live;
VERSE:and so Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be with you,
VERSE:as you say.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Hate evil, love good,
VERSE:and establish justice in the courts.
VERSE:It may be that Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the Lord, says:
VERSE:“Wailing will be in all the wide ways.
VERSE:They will say in all the streets, ‘Alas! Alas!’
VERSE:They will call the farmer to mourning,
VERSE:and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing.
LABEL:17
VERSE:In all vineyards there will be wailing,
VERSE:for I will pass through the middle of you,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:18
VERSE:“Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh!
VERSE:Why do you long for the day of Yahweh?
VERSE:It is darkness,
VERSE:and not light.
LABEL:19
VERSE:As if a man fled from a lion,
VERSE:and a bear met him;
VERSE:or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall,
VERSE:and a snake bit him.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Won’t the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light?
VERSE:Even very dark, and no brightness in it?
LABEL:21
VERSE:I hate, I despise your feasts,
VERSE:and I can’t stand your solemn assemblies.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings,
VERSE:I will not accept them;
VERSE:neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Take away from me the noise of your songs!
VERSE:I will not listen to the music of your harps.
LABEL:24
VERSE:But let justice roll on like rivers,
VERSE:and righteousness like a mighty stream.
LABEL:25
VERSE:“Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?
LABEL:26
VERSE:You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,” says Yahweh, whose name is the God of Armies.
