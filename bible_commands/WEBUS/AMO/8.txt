CHAPTER:8
TITLE:Amos 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He said, “Amos, what do you see?”
VERSE:I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
VERSE:Then Yahweh said to me,
VERSE:“The end has come on my people Israel.
VERSE:I will not again pass by them any more.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The songs of the temple will be wailing in that day,” says the Lord Yahweh.
VERSE:“The dead bodies will be many. In every place they will throw them out with silence.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Hear this, you who desire to swallow up the needy,
VERSE:and cause the poor of the land to fail,
LABEL:5
VERSE:saying, ‘When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain?
VERSE:And the Sabbath, that we may market wheat,
VERSE:making the ephah small, and the shekel large,
VERSE:and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;
LABEL:6
VERSE:that we may buy the poor for silver,
VERSE:and the needy for a pair of sandals,
VERSE:and sell the sweepings with the wheat?’”
LABEL:7
VERSE:Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob,
VERSE:“Surely I will never forget any of their works.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Won’t the land tremble for this,
VERSE:and everyone mourn who dwells in it?
VERSE:Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River;
VERSE:and it will be stirred up and sink again, like the River of Egypt.
LABEL:9
VERSE:It will happen in that day,” says the Lord Yahweh,
VERSE:“that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,
VERSE:and I will darken the earth in the clear day.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I will turn your feasts into mourning,
VERSE:and all your songs into lamentation;
VERSE:and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your bodies,
VERSE:and baldness on every head.
VERSE:I will make it like the mourning for an only son,
VERSE:and its end like a bitter day.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, the days come,” says the Lord Yahweh,
VERSE:“that I will send a famine in the land,
VERSE:not a famine of bread,
VERSE:nor a thirst for water,
VERSE:but of hearing Yahweh’s words.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They will wander from sea to sea,
VERSE:and from the north even to the east;
VERSE:they will run back and forth to seek Yahweh’s word,
VERSE:and will not find it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:In that day the beautiful virgins
VERSE:and the young men will faint for thirst.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,
VERSE:and say, ‘As your god, Dan, lives,’
VERSE:and, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’
VERSE:they will fall, and never rise up again.”
