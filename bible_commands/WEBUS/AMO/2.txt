TITLE:Amos 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh says:
VERSE:“For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four,
VERSE:I will not turn away its punishment,
VERSE:because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime;
LABEL:2
VERSE:but I will send a fire on Moab,
VERSE:and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth;
VERSE:and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;
LABEL:3
VERSE:and I will cut off the judge from among them,
VERSE:and will kill all its princes with him,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Yahweh says:
VERSE:“For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four,
VERSE:I will not turn away its punishment,
VERSE:because they have rejected Yahweh’s law,
VERSE:and have not kept his statutes,
VERSE:and their lies have led them astray,
VERSE:after which their fathers walked;
LABEL:5
VERSE:but I will send a fire on Judah,
VERSE:and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:Yahweh says:
VERSE:“For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four,
VERSE:I will not turn away its punishment,
VERSE:because they have sold the righteous for silver,
VERSE:and the needy for a pair of sandals;
LABEL:7
VERSE:They trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth
VERSE:and deny justice to the oppressed.
VERSE:A man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge.
VERSE:In the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,
VERSE:whose height was like the height of the cedars,
VERSE:and he was strong as the oaks;
VERSE:yet I destroyed his fruit from above,
VERSE:and his roots from beneath.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt
VERSE:and led you forty years in the wilderness,
VERSE:to possess the land of the Amorite.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I raised up some of your sons for prophets,
VERSE:and some of your young men for Nazirites.
VERSE:Isn’t this true,
VERSE:you children of Israel?” says Yahweh.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink,
VERSE:and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t prophesy!’
LABEL:13
VERSE:Behold, I will crush you in your place,
VERSE:as a cart crushes that is full of grain.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Flight will perish from the swift.
VERSE:The strong won’t strengthen his force.
VERSE:The mighty won’t deliver himself.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He who handles the bow won’t stand.
VERSE:He who is swift of foot won’t escape.
VERSE:He who rides the horse won’t deliver himself.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He who is courageous among the mighty
VERSE:will flee away naked on that day,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
