VERSE:and compare me, as if we were the same?

VERSE:and weigh silver in the balance.
VERSE:They hire a goldsmith,
VERSE:and he makes it a god.
VERSE:They fall down—
VERSE:yes, they worship.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They bear it on their shoulder.
VERSE:They carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands there.

VERSE:I declare the end from the beginning,
VERSE:and from ancient times things that are not yet done.

VERSE:the man of my counsel from a far country.

VERSE:It is not far off,
VERSE:and my salvation will not wait.
VERSE:I will grant salvation to Zion,
VERSE:my glory to Israel.
