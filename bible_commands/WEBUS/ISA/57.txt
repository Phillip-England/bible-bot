CHAPTER:57
TITLE:Isaiah 57
LABEL:1
VERSE:The righteous perish,
VERSE:and no one lays it to heart.
VERSE:Merciful men are taken away,
VERSE:and no one considers that the righteous is taken away from the evil.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He enters into peace.
VERSE:They rest in their beds,
VERSE:each one who walks in his uprightness.
LABEL:3
VERSE:“But draw near here, you sons of a sorceress,
VERSE:you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Whom do you mock?
VERSE:Against whom do you make a wide mouth
VERSE:and stick out your tongue?
VERSE:Aren’t you children of disobedience
VERSE:and offspring of falsehood,
LABEL:5
VERSE:you who inflame yourselves among the oaks,
VERSE:under every green tree;
VERSE:who kill the children in the valleys,
VERSE:under the clefts of the rocks?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion.
VERSE:They, they are your lot.
VERSE:You have even poured a drink offering to them.
VERSE:You have offered an offering.
VERSE:Shall I be appeased for these things?
LABEL:7
VERSE:On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed.
VERSE:You also went up there to offer sacrifice.
LABEL:8
VERSE:You have set up your memorial behind the doors and the posts,
VERSE:for you have exposed yourself to someone besides me,
VERSE:and have gone up.
VERSE:You have enlarged your bed
VERSE:and made you a covenant with them.
VERSE:You loved what you saw on their bed.
LABEL:9
VERSE:You went to the king with oil,
VERSE:increased your perfumes,
VERSE:sent your ambassadors far off,
VERSE:and degraded yourself even to Sheol.
LABEL:10
VERSE:You were wearied with the length of your ways;
VERSE:yet you didn’t say, ‘It is in vain.’
VERSE:You found a reviving of your strength;
VERSE:therefore you weren’t faint.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“Whom have you dreaded and feared,
VERSE:so that you lie,
VERSE:and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart?
VERSE:Haven’t I held my peace for a long time,
VERSE:and you don’t fear me?
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will declare your righteousness;
VERSE:and as for your works, they will not benefit you.
LABEL:13
VERSE:When you cry,
VERSE:let those whom you have gathered deliver you,
VERSE:but the wind will take them.
VERSE:A breath will carry them all away,
VERSE:but he who takes refuge in me will possess the land,
VERSE:and will inherit my holy mountain.”
LABEL:14
VERSE:He will say, “Build up, build up, prepare the way!
VERSE:Remove the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.”
LABEL:15
VERSE:For the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,
VERSE:whose name is Holy, says:
VERSE:“I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,
VERSE:to revive the spirit of the humble,
VERSE:and to revive the heart of the contrite.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For I will not contend forever, neither will I always be angry;
VERSE:for the spirit would faint before me,
VERSE:and the souls whom I have made.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I was angry because of the iniquity of his covetousness and struck him.
VERSE:I hid myself and was angry;
VERSE:and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I have seen his ways, and will heal him.
VERSE:I will lead him also,
VERSE:and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I create the fruit of the lips:
VERSE:Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near,”
VERSE:says Yahweh; “and I will heal them.”
LABEL:20
VERSE:But the wicked are like the troubled sea;
VERSE:for it can’t rest and its waters cast up mire and mud.
LABEL:21
VERSE:“There is no peace”, says my God,
VERSE:“for the wicked.”
