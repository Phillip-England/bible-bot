BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:47
TITLE:Isaiah 47
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon.
VERSE:Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans.
VERSE:For you will no longer be called tender and delicate.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Take the millstones and grind flour.
VERSE:Remove your veil, lift up your skirt, uncover your legs,
VERSE:and wade through the rivers.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Your nakedness will be uncovered.
VERSE:Yes, your shame will be seen.
VERSE:I will take vengeance,
VERSE:and will spare no one.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name,
VERSE:is the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:5
VERSE:“Sit in silence, and go into darkness,
VERSE:daughter of the Chaldeans.
VERSE:For you shall no longer be called
VERSE:the mistress of kingdoms.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I was angry with my people.
VERSE:I profaned my inheritance
VERSE:and gave them into your hand.
VERSE:You showed them no mercy.
VERSE:You laid a very heavy yoke on the aged.
LABEL:7
VERSE:You said, ‘I will be a princess forever,’
VERSE:so that you didn’t lay these things to your heart,
VERSE:nor did you remember the results.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures,
VERSE:who sit securely,
VERSE:who say in your heart,
VERSE:‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.
VERSE:I won’t sit as a widow,
VERSE:neither will I know the loss of children.’
LABEL:9
VERSE:But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day:
VERSE:the loss of children and widowhood.
VERSE:They will come on you in their full measure,
VERSE:in the multitude of your sorceries,
VERSE:and the great abundance of your enchantments.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For you have trusted in your wickedness.
VERSE:You have said, ‘No one sees me.’
VERSE:Your wisdom and your knowledge has perverted you.
VERSE:You have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.’
LABEL:11
VERSE:Therefore disaster will come on you.
VERSE:You won’t know when it dawns.
VERSE:Mischief will fall on you.
VERSE:You won’t be able to put it away.
VERSE:Desolation will come on you suddenly,
VERSE:which you don’t understand.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Stand now with your enchantments
VERSE:and with the multitude of your sorceries,
VERSE:in which you have labored from your youth,
VERSE:as if you might profit,
VERSE:as if you might prevail.
LABEL:13
VERSE:You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels.
VERSE:Now let the astrologers, the stargazers, and the monthly prognosticators stand up and save you from the things that will happen to you.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Behold, they are like stubble.
VERSE:The fire will burn them.
VERSE:They won’t deliver themselves from the power of the flame.
VERSE:It won’t be a coal to warm at
VERSE:or a fire to sit by.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The things that you labored in will be like this:
VERSE:those who have trafficked with you from your youth will each wander in his own way.
VERSE:There will be no one to save you.
