CHAPTER:49
TITLE:Isaiah 49
LABEL:1
VERSE:Listen, islands, to me.
VERSE:Listen, you peoples, from afar:
VERSE:Yahweh has called me from the womb;
VERSE:from the inside of my mother, he has mentioned my name.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He has made my mouth like a sharp sword.
VERSE:He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.
VERSE:He has made me a polished shaft.
VERSE:He has kept me close in his quiver.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He said to me, “You are my servant,
VERSE:Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:But I said, “I have labored in vain.
VERSE:I have spent my strength in vain for nothing;
VERSE:yet surely the justice due to me is with Yahweh,
VERSE:and my reward with my God.”
LABEL:5
VERSE:Now Yahweh, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
VERSE:says to bring Jacob again to him,
VERSE:and to gather Israel to him,
VERSE:for I am honorable in Yahweh’s eyes,
VERSE:and my God has become my strength.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
VERSE:and to restore the preserved of Israel.
VERSE:I will also give you as a light to the nations,
VERSE:that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,
VERSE:says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers:
VERSE:“Kings shall see and rise up,
VERSE:princes, and they shall worship,
VERSE:because of Yahweh who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yahweh says, “I have answered you in an acceptable time.
VERSE:I have helped you in a day of salvation.
VERSE:I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people,
VERSE:to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage,
LABEL:9
VERSE:saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’;
VERSE:to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’
VERSE:“They shall feed along the paths,
VERSE:and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They shall not hunger nor thirst;
VERSE:neither shall the heat nor sun strike them,
VERSE:for he who has mercy on them will lead them.
VERSE:He will guide them by springs of water.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I will make all my mountains a road,
VERSE:and my highways shall be exalted.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, these shall come from afar,
VERSE:and behold, these from the north and from the west,
VERSE:and these from the land of Sinim.”
LABEL:13
VERSE:Sing, heavens, and be joyful, earth!
VERSE:Break out into singing, mountains!
VERSE:For Yahweh has comforted his people,
VERSE:and will have compassion on his afflicted.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But Zion said, “Yahweh has forsaken me,
VERSE:and the Lord has forgotten me.”
LABEL:15
VERSE:“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
VERSE:that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?
VERSE:Yes, these may forget,
VERSE:yet I will not forget you!
LABEL:16
VERSE:Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.
VERSE:Your walls are continually before me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Your children hurry.
VERSE:Your destroyers and those who devastated you will leave you.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Lift up your eyes all around, and see:
VERSE:all these gather themselves together, and come to you.
VERSE:As I live,” says Yahweh, “you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament,
VERSE:and dress yourself with them, like a bride.
LABEL:19
VERSE:“For, as for your waste and your desolate places,
VERSE:and your land that has been destroyed,
VERSE:surely now that land will be too small for the inhabitants,
VERSE:and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The children of your bereavement will say in your ears,
VERSE:‘This place is too small for me.
VERSE:Give me a place to live in.’
LABEL:21
VERSE:Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children
VERSE:and am alone, an exile, and wandering back and forth?
VERSE:Who has brought these up?
VERSE:Behold, I was left alone. Where were these?’”
LABEL:22
VERSE:The Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,
VERSE:and lift up my banner to the peoples.
VERSE:They shall bring your sons in their bosom,
VERSE:and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Kings shall be your foster fathers,
VERSE:and their queens your nursing mothers.
VERSE:They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth,
VERSE:and lick the dust of your feet.
VERSE:Then you will know that I am Yahweh;
VERSE:and those who wait for me won’t be disappointed.”
LABEL:24
VERSE:Shall the plunder be taken from the mighty,
VERSE:or the lawful captives be delivered?
LABEL:25
VERSE:But Yahweh says, “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,
VERSE:and the plunder retrieved from the fierce,
VERSE:for I will contend with him who contends with you
VERSE:and I will save your children.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh;
VERSE:and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine.
VERSE:Then all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior
VERSE:and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
