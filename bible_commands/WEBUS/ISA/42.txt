TITLE:Isaiah 42
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Behold, my servant, whom I uphold,
VERSE:my chosen, in whom my soul delights:
VERSE:I have put my Spirit on him.
VERSE:He will bring justice to the nations.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He will not shout,
VERSE:nor raise his voice,
VERSE:nor cause it to be heard in the street.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He won’t break a bruised reed.
VERSE:He won’t quench a dimly burning wick.
VERSE:He will faithfully bring justice.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He will not fail nor be discouraged,
VERSE:until he has set justice in the earth,
VERSE:and the islands wait for his law.”
LABEL:5
VERSE:God Yahweh,
VERSE:he who created the heavens and stretched them out,
VERSE:he who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it,
VERSE:he who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it, says:
LABEL:6
VERSE:“I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness.
VERSE:I will hold your hand.
VERSE:I will keep you,
VERSE:and make you a covenant for the people,
VERSE:as a light for the nations,
LABEL:7
VERSE:to open the blind eyes,
VERSE:to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon,
VERSE:and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“I am Yahweh.
VERSE:That is my name.
VERSE:I will not give my glory to another,
VERSE:nor my praise to engraved images.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Behold, the former things have happened
VERSE:and I declare new things.
VERSE:I tell you about them before they come up.”
LABEL:10
VERSE:Sing to Yahweh a new song,
VERSE:and his praise from the end of the earth,
VERSE:you who go down to the sea,
VERSE:and all that is therein,
VERSE:the islands and their inhabitants.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices,
VERSE:with the villages that Kedar inhabits.
VERSE:Let the inhabitants of Sela sing.
VERSE:Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let them give glory to Yahweh,
VERSE:and declare his praise in the islands.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yahweh will go out like a mighty man.
VERSE:He will stir up zeal like a man of war.
VERSE:He will raise a war cry.
VERSE:Yes, he will shout aloud.
VERSE:He will triumph over his enemies.
LABEL:14
VERSE:“I have been silent a long time.
VERSE:I have been quiet and restrained myself.
VERSE:Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will both gasp and pant.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I will destroy mountains and hills,
VERSE:and dry up all their herbs.
VERSE:I will make the rivers islands,
VERSE:and will dry up the pools.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I will bring the blind by a way that they don’t know.
VERSE:I will lead them in paths that they don’t know.
VERSE:I will make darkness light before them,
VERSE:and crooked places straight.
VERSE:I will do these things,
VERSE:and I will not forsake them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“Those who trust in engraved images,
VERSE:who tell molten images,
VERSE:‘You are our gods,’
VERSE:will be turned back.
VERSE:They will be utterly disappointed.
LABEL:18
VERSE:“Hear, you deaf,
VERSE:and look, you blind,
VERSE:that you may see.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Who is blind, but my servant?
VERSE:Or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send?
VERSE:Who is as blind as he who is at peace,
VERSE:and as blind as Yahweh’s servant?
LABEL:20
VERSE:You see many things, but don’t observe.
VERSE:His ears are open, but he doesn’t listen.
LABEL:21
VERSE:It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law
VERSE:and make it honorable.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But this is a robbed and plundered people.
VERSE:All of them are snared in holes,
VERSE:and they are hidden in prisons.
VERSE:They have become captives, and no one delivers,
VERSE:and a plunder, and no one says, ‘Restore them!’
LABEL:23
VERSE:Who is there among you who will give ear to this?
VERSE:Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Who gave Jacob as plunder,
VERSE:and Israel to the robbers?
VERSE:Didn’t Yahweh, he against whom we have sinned?
VERSE:For they would not walk in his ways,
VERSE:and they disobeyed his law.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,
VERSE:and the strength of battle.
VERSE:It set him on fire all around, but he didn’t know.
VERSE:It burned him, but he didn’t take it to heart.”
