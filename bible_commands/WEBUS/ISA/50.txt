TITLE:Isaiah 50
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh says, “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, with which I have put her away?
VERSE:Or to which of my creditors have I sold you?
VERSE:Behold, you were sold for your iniquities,
VERSE:and your mother was put away for your transgressions.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Why, when I came, was there no one?
VERSE:When I called, why was there no one to answer?
VERSE:Is my hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem?
VERSE:Or have I no power to deliver?
VERSE:Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea.
VERSE:I make the rivers a wilderness.
VERSE:Their fish stink because there is no water, and die of thirst.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I clothe the heavens with blackness.
VERSE:I make sackcloth their covering.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught,
VERSE:that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary.
VERSE:He awakens morning by morning,
VERSE:he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear.
VERSE:I was not rebellious.
VERSE:I have not turned back.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I gave my back to those who beat me,
VERSE:and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair.
VERSE:I didn’t hide my face from shame and spitting.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For the Lord Yahweh will help me.
VERSE:Therefore I have not been confounded.
VERSE:Therefore I have set my face like a flint,
VERSE:and I know that I won’t be disappointed.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He who justifies me is near.
VERSE:Who will bring charges against me?
VERSE:Let us stand up together.
VERSE:Who is my adversary?
VERSE:Let him come near to me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help me!
VERSE:Who is he who will condemn me?
VERSE:Behold, they will all grow old like a garment.
VERSE:The moths will eat them up.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Who among you fears Yahweh
VERSE:and obeys the voice of his servant?
VERSE:He who walks in darkness
VERSE:and has no light,
VERSE:let him trust in Yahweh’s name,
VERSE:and rely on his God.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, all you who kindle a fire,
VERSE:who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves,
VERSE:walk in the flame of your fire,
VERSE:and among the torches that you have kindled.
VERSE:You will have this from my hand:
VERSE:you will lie down in sorrow.
