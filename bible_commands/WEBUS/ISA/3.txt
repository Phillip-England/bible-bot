CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Isaiah 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support,
VERSE:the whole supply of bread,
VERSE:and the whole supply of water;
LABEL:2
VERSE:the mighty man,
VERSE:the man of war,
VERSE:the judge,
VERSE:the prophet,
VERSE:the diviner,
VERSE:the elder,
LABEL:3
VERSE:the captain of fifty,
VERSE:the honorable man,
VERSE:the counselor,
VERSE:the skilled craftsman,
VERSE:and the clever enchanter.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will give boys to be their princes,
VERSE:and children shall rule over them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The people will be oppressed,
VERSE:everyone by another,
VERSE:and everyone by his neighbor.
VERSE:The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,
VERSE:and the wicked against the honorable.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,
VERSE:“You have clothing, you be our ruler,
VERSE:and let this ruin be under your hand.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer;
VERSE:for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
VERSE:You shall not make me ruler of the people.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen;
VERSE:because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh,
VERSE:to provoke the eyes of his glory.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The look of their faces testify against them.
VERSE:They parade their sin like Sodom.
VERSE:They don’t hide it.
VERSE:Woe to their soul!
VERSE:For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Tell the righteous that it will be well with them,
VERSE:for they will eat the fruit of their deeds.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Woe to the wicked!
VERSE:Disaster is upon them,
VERSE:for the deeds of their hands will be paid back to them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:As for my people, children are their oppressors,
VERSE:and women rule over them.
VERSE:My people, those who lead you cause you to err,
VERSE:and destroy the way of your paths.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yahweh stands up to contend,
VERSE:and stands to judge the peoples.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people
VERSE:and their leaders:
VERSE:“It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
VERSE:The plunder of the poor is in your houses.
LABEL:15
VERSE:What do you mean that you crush my people,
VERSE:and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Moreover Yahweh said, “Because the daughters of Zion are arrogant,
VERSE:and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,
VERSE:walking daintily as they go,
VERSE:jingling ornaments on their feet;
LABEL:17
VERSE:therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,
VERSE:and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.”
LABEL:18
VERSE:In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,
LABEL:19
VERSE:the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
LABEL:20
VERSE:the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume containers, the charms,
LABEL:21
VERSE:the signet rings, the nose rings,
LABEL:22
VERSE:the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
LABEL:23
VERSE:the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.
LABEL:24
VERSE:It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;
VERSE:instead of a belt, a rope;
VERSE:instead of well set hair, baldness;
VERSE:instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;
VERSE:and branding instead of beauty.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Your men shall fall by the sword,
VERSE:and your mighty in the war.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Her gates shall lament and mourn.
VERSE:She shall be desolate and sit on the ground.
