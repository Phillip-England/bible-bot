TITLE:Isaiah 41
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Keep silent before me, islands,
VERSE:and let the peoples renew their strength.
VERSE:Let them come near,
VERSE:then let them speak.
VERSE:Let’s meet together for judgment.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Who has raised up one from the east?
VERSE:Who called him to his feet in righteousness?
VERSE:He hands over nations to him
VERSE:and makes him rule over kings.
VERSE:He gives them like the dust to his sword,
VERSE:like the driven stubble to his bow.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He pursues them
VERSE:and passes by safely,
VERSE:even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who has worked and done it,
VERSE:calling the generations from the beginning?
VERSE:I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last, I am he.”
LABEL:5
VERSE:The islands have seen, and fear.
VERSE:The ends of the earth tremble.
VERSE:They approach, and come.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Everyone helps his neighbor.
VERSE:They say to their brothers, “Be strong!”
LABEL:7
VERSE:So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.
VERSE:He who smooths with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,
VERSE:saying of the soldering, “It is good;”
VERSE:and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“But you, Israel, my servant,
VERSE:Jacob whom I have chosen,
VERSE:the offspring of Abraham my friend,
LABEL:9
VERSE:you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,
VERSE:and called from its corners,
VERSE:and said to you, ‘You are my servant. I have chosen you and have not cast you away.’
LABEL:10
VERSE:Don’t you be afraid, for I am with you.
VERSE:Don’t be dismayed, for I am your God.
VERSE:I will strengthen you.
VERSE:Yes, I will help you.
VERSE:Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded.
VERSE:Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish.
LABEL:12
VERSE:You will seek them, and won’t find them,
VERSE:even those who contend with you.
VERSE:Those who war against you will be as nothing,
VERSE:as a nonexistent thing.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand,
VERSE:saying to you, ‘Don’t be afraid.
VERSE:I will help you.’
LABEL:14
VERSE:Don’t be afraid, you worm Jacob,
VERSE:and you men of Israel.
VERSE:I will help you,” says Yahweh.
VERSE:“Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth.
VERSE:You will thresh the mountains,
VERSE:and beat them small,
VERSE:and will make the hills like chaff.
LABEL:16
VERSE:You will winnow them,
VERSE:and the wind will carry them away,
VERSE:and the whirlwind will scatter them.
VERSE:You will rejoice in Yahweh.
VERSE:You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.
VERSE:Their tongue fails for thirst.
VERSE:I, Yahweh, will answer them.
VERSE:I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I will open rivers on the bare heights,
VERSE:and springs in the middle of the valleys.
VERSE:I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
VERSE:and the dry land springs of water.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.
VERSE:I will set cypress trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;
LABEL:20
VERSE:that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,
VERSE:that Yahweh’s hand has done this,
VERSE:and the Holy One of Israel has created it.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Produce your cause,” says Yahweh.
VERSE:“Bring out your strong reasons!” says the King of Jacob.
LABEL:22
VERSE:“Let them announce and declare to us what will happen!
VERSE:Declare the former things, what they are,
VERSE:that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;
VERSE:or show us things to come.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Declare the things that are to come hereafter,
VERSE:that we may know that you are gods.
VERSE:Yes, do good, or do evil,
VERSE:that we may be dismayed,
VERSE:and see it together.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Behold, you are nothing,
VERSE:and your work is nothing.
VERSE:He who chooses you is an abomination.
LABEL:25
VERSE:“I have raised up one from the north, and he has come,
VERSE:from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name,
VERSE:and he shall come on rulers as on mortar,
VERSE:and as the potter treads clay.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?
VERSE:and before, that we may say, ‘He is right’?
VERSE:Surely, there is no one who declares.
VERSE:Surely, there is no one who shows.
VERSE:Surely, there is no one who hears your words.
LABEL:27
VERSE:I am the first to say to Zion, ‘Behold, look at them;’
VERSE:and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.
LABEL:28
VERSE:When I look, there is no man,
VERSE:even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask, can answer a word.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Behold, all of their deeds are vanity and nothing.
VERSE:Their molten images are wind and confusion.
