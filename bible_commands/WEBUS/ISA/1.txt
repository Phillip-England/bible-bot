TRANSLATION:WEBUS
BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Isaiah 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear, heavens,
VERSE:and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:
VERSE:“I have nourished and brought up children
VERSE:and they have rebelled against me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The ox knows his owner,
VERSE:and the donkey his master’s crib;
VERSE:but Israel doesn’t know.
VERSE:My people don’t consider.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:Ah sinful nation,
VERSE:a people loaded with iniquity,
VERSE:offspring of evildoers,
VERSE:children who deal corruptly!
VERSE:They have forsaken Yahweh.
VERSE:They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
VERSE:They are estranged and backward.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Why should you be beaten more,
VERSE:that you revolt more and more?
VERSE:The whole head is sick,
VERSE:and the whole heart faint.
LABEL:6
VERSE:From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it,
VERSE:but wounds, welts, and open sores.
VERSE:They haven’t been closed, bandaged, or soothed with oil.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Your country is desolate.
VERSE:Your cities are burned with fire.
VERSE:Strangers devour your land in your presence
VERSE:and it is desolate,
VERSE:as overthrown by strangers.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
VERSE:like a hut in a field of melons,
VERSE:like a besieged city.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,
VERSE:we would have been as Sodom.
VERSE:We would have been like Gomorrah.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Hear Yahweh’s word, you rulers of Sodom!
VERSE:Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
LABEL:11
VERSE:“What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”, says Yahweh.
VERSE:“I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams
VERSE:and the fat of fed animals.
VERSE:I don’t delight in the blood of bulls,
VERSE:or of lambs,
VERSE:or of male goats.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When you come to appear before me,
VERSE:who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Bring no more vain offerings.
VERSE:Incense is an abomination to me.
VERSE:New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations—
VERSE:I can’t stand evil assemblies.
LABEL:14
VERSE:My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.
VERSE:They are a burden to me.
VERSE:I am weary of bearing them.
LABEL:15
VERSE:When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
VERSE:Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
VERSE:Your hands are full of blood.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Wash yourselves. Make yourself clean.
VERSE:Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.
VERSE:Cease to do evil.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Learn to do well.
VERSE:Seek justice.
VERSE:Relieve the oppressed.
VERSE:Defend the fatherless.
VERSE:Plead for the widow.”
LABEL:18
VERSE:“Come now, and let’s reason together,” says Yahweh:
VERSE:“Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
VERSE:Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
LABEL:19
VERSE:If you are willing and obedient,
VERSE:you will eat the good of the land;
LABEL:20
VERSE:but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword;
VERSE:for Yahweh’s mouth has spoken it.”
LABEL:21
VERSE:How the faithful city has become a prostitute!
VERSE:She was full of justice.
VERSE:Righteousness lodged in her,
VERSE:but now there are murderers.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Your silver has become dross,
VERSE:your wine mixed with water.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves.
VERSE:Everyone loves bribes and follows after rewards.
VERSE:They don’t defend the fatherless,
VERSE:neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,
VERSE:the Mighty One of Israel, says:
VERSE:“Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
VERSE:and avenge myself on my enemies.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I will turn my hand on you,
VERSE:thoroughly purge away your dross,
VERSE:and will take away all your tin.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I will restore your judges as at the first,
VERSE:and your counselors as at the beginning.
VERSE:Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness,
VERSE:a faithful town.’
LABEL:27
VERSE:Zion shall be redeemed with justice,
VERSE:and her converts with righteousness.
LABEL:28
VERSE:But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
VERSE:and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
LABEL:29
VERSE:For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
VERSE:and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
LABEL:30
VERSE:For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,
VERSE:and as a garden that has no water.
LABEL:31
VERSE:The strong will be like tinder,
VERSE:and his work like a spark.
VERSE:They will both burn together,
VERSE:and no one will quench them.”
