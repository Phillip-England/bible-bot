CHAPTER:64
TITLE:Isaiah 64
LABEL:1
VERSE:Oh that you would tear the heavens,
VERSE:that you would come down,
VERSE:that the mountains might quake at your presence—
LABEL:2
VERSE:as when fire kindles the brushwood,
VERSE:and the fire causes the water to boil.
VERSE:Make your name known to your adversaries,
VERSE:that the nations may tremble at your presence!
LABEL:3
VERSE:When you did awesome things which we didn’t look for,
VERSE:you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For from of old men have not heard,
VERSE:nor perceived by the ear,
VERSE:nor has the eye seen a God besides you,
VERSE:who works for him who waits for him.
LABEL:5
VERSE:You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness,
VERSE:those who remember you in your ways.
VERSE:Behold, you were angry, and we sinned.
VERSE:We have been in sin for a long time.
VERSE:Shall we be saved?
LABEL:6
VERSE:For we have all become like one who is unclean,
VERSE:and all our righteousness is like a polluted garment.
VERSE:We all fade like a leaf;
VERSE:and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
LABEL:7
VERSE:There is no one who calls on your name,
VERSE:who stirs himself up to take hold of you;
VERSE:for you have hidden your face from us,
VERSE:and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But now, Yahweh, you are our Father.
VERSE:We are the clay and you our potter.
VERSE:We all are the work of your hand.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Don’t be furious, Yahweh.
VERSE:Don’t remember iniquity forever.
VERSE:Look and see, we beg you,
VERSE:we are all your people.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Your holy cities have become a wilderness.
VERSE:Zion has become a wilderness,
VERSE:Jerusalem a desolation.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised you
VERSE:is burned with fire.
VERSE:All our pleasant places are laid waste.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Will you hold yourself back for these things, Yahweh?
VERSE:Will you keep silent and punish us very severely?
