TITLE:Isaiah 52
LABEL:1
VERSE:Awake, awake! Put on your strength, Zion.
VERSE:Put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city,
VERSE:for from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean will no more come into you.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Shake yourself from the dust!
VERSE:Arise, sit up, Jerusalem!
VERSE:Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!
LABEL:3
VERSE:For Yahweh says, “You were sold for nothing;
VERSE:and you will be redeemed without money.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:For the Lord Yahweh says:
VERSE:“My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there;
VERSE:and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.
LABEL:5
VERSE:“Now therefore, what do I do here,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“seeing that my people are taken away for nothing?
VERSE:Those who rule over them mock,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“and my name is blasphemed continually all day long.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Therefore my people shall know my name.
VERSE:Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks.
VERSE:Behold, it is I.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news,
VERSE:who publishes peace,
VERSE:who brings good news,
VERSE:who proclaims salvation,
VERSE:who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
LABEL:8
VERSE:Your watchmen lift up their voice.
VERSE:Together they sing;
VERSE:for they shall see eye to eye when Yahweh returns to Zion.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Break out into joy!
VERSE:Sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem;
VERSE:for Yahweh has comforted his people.
VERSE:He has redeemed Jerusalem.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Yahweh has made his holy arm bare in the eyes of all the nations.
VERSE:All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch no unclean thing!
VERSE:Go out from among her!
VERSE:Cleanse yourselves, you who carry Yahweh’s vessels.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For you shall not go out in haste,
VERSE:neither shall you go by flight;
VERSE:for Yahweh will go before you,
VERSE:and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Behold, my servant will deal wisely.
VERSE:He will be exalted and lifted up,
VERSE:and will be very high.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Just as many were astonished at you—
VERSE:his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—
LABEL:15
VERSE:so he will cleanse many nations.
VERSE:Kings will shut their mouths at him;
VERSE:for they will see that which had not been told them,
VERSE:and they will understand that which they had not heard.
