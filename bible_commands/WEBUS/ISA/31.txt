CHAPTER:31
TITLE:Isaiah 31
LABEL:1
VERSE:Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,
VERSE:and rely on horses,
VERSE:and trust in chariots because they are many,
VERSE:and in horsemen because they are very strong,
VERSE:but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel,
VERSE:and they don’t seek Yahweh!
LABEL:2
VERSE:Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,
VERSE:and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers,
VERSE:and against the help of those who work iniquity.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;
VERSE:and their horses flesh, and not spirit.
VERSE:When Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble,
VERSE:and he who is helped shall fall,
VERSE:and they all shall be consumed together.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For Yahweh says to me,
VERSE:“As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,
VERSE:if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,
VERSE:will not be dismayed at their voice,
VERSE:nor abase himself for their noise,
VERSE:so Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.
LABEL:5
VERSE:As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.
VERSE:He will protect and deliver it.
VERSE:He will pass over and preserve it.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—sin which your own hands have made for you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;
VERSE:and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him.
VERSE:He will flee from the sword,
VERSE:and his young men will become subject to forced labor.
LABEL:9
VERSE:His rock will pass away by reason of terror,
VERSE:and his princes will be afraid of the banner,”
VERSE:says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion,
VERSE:and his furnace in Jerusalem.
