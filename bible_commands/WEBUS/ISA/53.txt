BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:53
TITLE:Isaiah 53
LABEL:1
VERSE:Who has believed our message?
VERSE:To whom has Yahweh’s arm been revealed?
LABEL:2
VERSE:For he grew up before him as a tender plant,
VERSE:and as a root out of dry ground.
VERSE:He has no good looks or majesty.
VERSE:When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He was despised
VERSE:and rejected by men,
VERSE:a man of suffering
VERSE:and acquainted with disease.
VERSE:He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;
VERSE:and we didn’t respect him.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Surely he has borne our sickness
VERSE:and carried our suffering;
VERSE:yet we considered him plagued,
VERSE:struck by God, and afflicted.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But he was pierced for our transgressions.
VERSE:He was crushed for our iniquities.
VERSE:The punishment that brought our peace was on him;
VERSE:and by his wounds we are healed.
LABEL:6
VERSE:All we like sheep have gone astray.
VERSE:Everyone has turned to his own way;
VERSE:and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He was oppressed,
VERSE:yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth.
VERSE:As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
VERSE:and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
VERSE:so he didn’t open his mouth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He was taken away by oppression and judgment.
VERSE:As for his generation,
VERSE:who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living
VERSE:and stricken for the disobedience of my people?
LABEL:9
VERSE:They made his grave with the wicked,
VERSE:and with a rich man in his death,
VERSE:although he had done no violence,
VERSE:nor was any deceit in his mouth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.
VERSE:He has caused him to suffer.
VERSE:When you make his soul an offering for sin,
VERSE:he will see his offspring.
VERSE:He will prolong his days
VERSE:and Yahweh’s pleasure will prosper in his hand.
LABEL:11
VERSE:After the suffering of his soul,
VERSE:he will see the light and be satisfied.
VERSE:My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;
VERSE:and he will bear their iniquities.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore I will give him a portion with the great.
VERSE:He will divide the plunder with the strong,
VERSE:because he poured out his soul to death
VERSE:and was counted with the transgressors;
VERSE:yet he bore the sins of many
VERSE:and made intercession for the transgressors.
