BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:26
TITLE:Isaiah 26
LABEL:1
VERSE:In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
VERSE:“We have a strong city.
VERSE:God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:
VERSE:the one which keeps faith.
LABEL:3
VERSE:You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
VERSE:because he trusts in you.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Trust in Yahweh forever;
VERSE:for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
VERSE:He lays it low.
VERSE:He lays it low even to the ground.
VERSE:He brings it even to the dust.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The foot shall tread it down,
VERSE:even the feet of the poor
VERSE:and the steps of the needy.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:The way of the just is uprightness.
VERSE:You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we have waited for you.
VERSE:Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.
LABEL:9
VERSE:With my soul I have desired you in the night.
VERSE:Yes, with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly;
VERSE:for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Let favor be shown to the wicked,
VERSE:yet he will not learn righteousness.
VERSE:In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,
VERSE:and will not see Yahweh’s majesty.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see;
VERSE:but they will see your zeal for the people and be disappointed.
VERSE:Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us,
VERSE:for you have also done all our work for us.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,
VERSE:but we will only acknowledge your name.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The dead shall not live.
VERSE:The departed spirits shall not rise.
VERSE:Therefore you have visited and destroyed them,
VERSE:and caused all memory of them to perish.
LABEL:15
VERSE:You have increased the nation, O Yahweh.
VERSE:You have increased the nation!
VERSE:You are glorified!
VERSE:You have enlarged all the borders of the land.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you.
VERSE:They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Just as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery,
VERSE:is in pain and cries out in her pangs,
VERSE:so we have been before you, Yahweh.
LABEL:18
VERSE:We have been with child.
VERSE:We have been in pain.
VERSE:We gave birth, it seems, only to wind.
VERSE:We have not worked any deliverance in the earth;
VERSE:neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Your dead shall live.
VERSE:Their dead bodies shall arise.
VERSE:Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust;
VERSE:for your dew is like the dew of herbs,
VERSE:and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Come, my people, enter into your rooms,
VERSE:and shut your doors behind you.
VERSE:Hide yourself for a little moment,
VERSE:until the indignation is past.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.
VERSE:The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.
