CHAPTER:44
TITLE:Isaiah 44
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yet listen now, Jacob my servant,
VERSE:and Israel, whom I have chosen.
LABEL:2
VERSE:This is what Yahweh who made you,
VERSE:and formed you from the womb,
VERSE:who will help you says:
VERSE:“Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant;
VERSE:and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I will pour water on him who is thirsty,
VERSE:and streams on the dry ground.
VERSE:I will pour my Spirit on your descendants,
VERSE:and my blessing on your offspring;
LABEL:4
VERSE:and they will spring up among the grass,
VERSE:as willows by the watercourses.
LABEL:5
VERSE:One will say, ‘I am Yahweh’s.’
VERSE:Another will be called by the name of Jacob;
VERSE:and another will write with his hand ‘to Yahweh,’
VERSE:and honor the name of Israel.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:This is what Yahweh, the King of Israel,
VERSE:and his Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies, says:
VERSE:“I am the first, and I am the last;
VERSE:and besides me there is no God.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Who is like me?
VERSE:Who will call,
VERSE:and will declare it,
VERSE:and set it in order for me,
VERSE:since I established the ancient people?
VERSE:Let them declare the things that are coming,
VERSE:and that will happen.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Don’t fear,
VERSE:neither be afraid.
VERSE:Haven’t I declared it to you long ago,
VERSE:and shown it?
VERSE:You are my witnesses.
VERSE:Is there a God besides me?
VERSE:Indeed, there is not.
VERSE:I don’t know any other Rock.”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Everyone who makes a carved image is vain.
VERSE:The things that they delight in will not profit.
VERSE:Their own witnesses don’t see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Who has fashioned a god,
VERSE:or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed;
VERSE:and the workmen are mere men.
VERSE:Let them all be gathered together.
VERSE:Let them stand up.
VERSE:They will fear.
VERSE:They will be put to shame together.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The blacksmith takes an ax,
VERSE:works in the coals,
VERSE:fashions it with hammers,
VERSE:and works it with his strong arm.
VERSE:He is hungry,
VERSE:and his strength fails;
VERSE:he drinks no water,
VERSE:and is faint.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The carpenter stretches out a line.
VERSE:He marks it out with a pencil.
VERSE:He shapes it with planes.
VERSE:He marks it out with compasses,
VERSE:and shapes it like the figure of a man,
VERSE:with the beauty of a man,
VERSE:to reside in a house.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He cuts down cedars for himself,
VERSE:and takes the cypress and the oak,
VERSE:and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest.
VERSE:He plants a cypress tree,
VERSE:and the rain nourishes it.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then it will be for a man to burn;
VERSE:and he takes some of it and warms himself.
VERSE:Yes, he burns it and bakes bread.
VERSE:Yes, he makes a god and worships it;
VERSE:he makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He burns part of it in the fire.
VERSE:With part of it, he eats meat.
VERSE:He roasts a roast and is satisfied.
VERSE:Yes, he warms himself
VERSE:and says, “Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.”
LABEL:17
VERSE:The rest of it he makes into a god,
VERSE:even his engraved image.
VERSE:He bows down to it and worships,
VERSE:and prays to it, and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!”
LABEL:18
VERSE:They don’t know, neither do they consider,
VERSE:for he has shut their eyes, that they can’t see,
VERSE:and their hearts, that they can’t understand.
LABEL:19
VERSE:No one thinks,
VERSE:neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,
VERSE:“I have burned part of it in the fire.
VERSE:Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals.
VERSE:I have roasted meat and eaten it.
VERSE:Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?
VERSE:Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?”
LABEL:20
VERSE:He feeds on ashes.
VERSE:A deceived heart has turned him aside;
VERSE:and he can’t deliver his soul,
VERSE:nor say, “Isn’t there a lie in my right hand?”
LABEL:21
VERSE:Remember these things, Jacob and Israel,
VERSE:for you are my servant.
VERSE:I have formed you.
VERSE:You are my servant.
VERSE:Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions,
VERSE:and, as a cloud, your sins.
VERSE:Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Sing, you heavens, for Yahweh has done it!
VERSE:Shout, you lower parts of the earth!
VERSE:Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees,
VERSE:for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob,
VERSE:and will glorify himself in Israel.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Yahweh, your Redeemer,
VERSE:and he who formed you from the womb says:
VERSE:“I am Yahweh, who makes all things;
VERSE:who alone stretches out the heavens;
VERSE:who spreads out the earth by myself;
LABEL:25
VERSE:who frustrates the signs of the liars,
VERSE:and makes diviners mad;
VERSE:who turns wise men backward,
VERSE:and makes their knowledge foolish;
LABEL:26
VERSE:who confirms the word of his servant,
VERSE:and performs the counsel of his messengers;
VERSE:who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited;’
VERSE:and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be built,’
VERSE:and ‘I will raise up its waste places;’
LABEL:27
VERSE:who says to the deep, ‘Be dry,’
VERSE:and ‘I will dry up your rivers,’
LABEL:28
VERSE:who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,’
VERSE:even saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be built;’
VERSE:and of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’”
