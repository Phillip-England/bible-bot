VERSE:“Arise, shine; for your light has come,
VERSE:and Yahweh’s glory has risen on you!

VERSE:and thick darkness the peoples;
VERSE:but Yahweh will arise on you,
VERSE:and his glory shall be seen on you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Nations will come to your light,
VERSE:and kings to the brightness of your rising.

VERSE:“Lift up your eyes all around, and see:
VERSE:they all gather themselves together.
VERSE:They come to you.
VERSE:Your sons will come from far away,
VERSE:and your daughters will be carried in arms.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Then you shall see and be radiant,
VERSE:and your heart will thrill and be enlarged;
VERSE:because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you.
VERSE:The wealth of the nations will come to you.
LABEL:6
VERSE:A multitude of camels will cover you,
VERSE:the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah.

VERSE:and will proclaim the praises of Yahweh.
LABEL:7
VERSE:All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you.

VERSE:“Who are these who fly as a cloud,
VERSE:and as the doves to their windows?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Surely the islands will wait for me,
VERSE:and the ships of Tarshish first,
VERSE:to bring your sons from far away,
VERSE:their silver and their gold with them,
VERSE:for the name of Yahweh your God,
VERSE:and for the Holy One of Israel,
VERSE:because he has glorified you.
LABEL:10
VERSE:“Foreigners will build up your walls,
VERSE:and their kings will serve you;
VERSE:for in my wrath I struck you,
VERSE:but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you;
VERSE:and all those who despised you will bow themselves down at the soles of your feet.
VERSE:They will call you Yahweh’s City,
VERSE:the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:15
VERSE:“Whereas you have been forsaken and hated,
VERSE:so that no one passed through you,
VERSE:I will make you an eternal excellency,
VERSE:a joy of many generations.
LABEL:16
VERSE:You will also drink the milk of the nations,
VERSE:and will nurse from royal breasts.
VERSE:Then you will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior,
VERSE:your Redeemer,
VERSE:the Mighty One of Jacob.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For bronze I will bring gold;
VERSE:for iron I will bring silver;
VERSE:for wood, bronze,
VERSE:and for stones, iron.
VERSE:I will also make peace your governor,
VERSE:and righteousness your ruler.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Violence shall no more be heard in your land,
VERSE:nor desolation or destruction within your borders;
VERSE:but you will call your walls Salvation,
VERSE:and your gates Praise.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The sun will be no more your light by day,
VERSE:nor will the brightness of the moon give light to you,
VERSE:but Yahweh will be your everlasting light,
VERSE:and your God will be your glory.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Your sun will not go down any more,
VERSE:nor will your moon withdraw itself;
VERSE:for Yahweh will be your everlasting light,
VERSE:and the days of your mourning will end.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Then your people will all be righteous.
VERSE:They will inherit the land forever,
VERSE:the branch of my planting,
VERSE:the work of my hands,
VERSE:that I may be glorified.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The little one will become a thousand,
VERSE:and the small one a strong nation.
VERSE:I, Yahweh, will do this quickly in its time.”
