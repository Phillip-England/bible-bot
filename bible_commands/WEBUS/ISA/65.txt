BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:65
TITLE:Isaiah 65
LABEL:1
VERSE:“I am inquired of by those who didn’t ask.
VERSE:I am found by those who didn’t seek me.
VERSE:I said, ‘See me, see me,’ to a nation that was not called by my name.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I have spread out my hands all day to a rebellious people,
VERSE:who walk in a way that is not good,
VERSE:after their own thoughts;
LABEL:3
VERSE:a people who provoke me to my face continually,
VERSE:sacrificing in gardens,
VERSE:and burning incense on bricks;
LABEL:4
VERSE:who sit among the graves,
VERSE:and spend nights in secret places;
VERSE:who eat pig’s meat,
VERSE:and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
LABEL:5
VERSE:who say, ‘Stay by yourself,
VERSE:don’t come near to me,
VERSE:for I am holier than you.’
VERSE:These are smoke in my nose,
VERSE:a fire that burns all day.
LABEL:6
VERSE:“Behold, it is written before me:
VERSE:I will not keep silence,
VERSE:but will repay,
VERSE:yes, I will repay into their bosom
LABEL:7
VERSE:your own iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together”, says Yahweh,
VERSE:“who have burned incense on the mountains,
VERSE:and blasphemed me on the hills.
VERSE:Therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yahweh says,
VERSE:“As the new wine is found in the cluster,
VERSE:and one says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’
VERSE:so I will do for my servants’ sake,
VERSE:that I may not destroy them all.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I will bring offspring out of Jacob,
VERSE:and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains.
VERSE:My chosen will inherit it,
VERSE:and my servants will dwell there.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Sharon will be a fold of flocks,
VERSE:and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in,
VERSE:for my people who have sought me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“But you who forsake Yahweh,
VERSE:who forget my holy mountain,
VERSE:who prepare a table for Fortune,
VERSE:and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will destine you to the sword,
VERSE:and you will all bow down to the slaughter;
VERSE:because when I called, you didn’t answer.
VERSE:When I spoke, you didn’t listen;
VERSE:but you did that which was evil in my eyes,
VERSE:and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”
LABEL:13
VERSE:Therefore the Lord Yahweh says,
VERSE:“Behold, my servants will eat,
VERSE:but you will be hungry;
VERSE:behold, my servants will drink,
VERSE:but you will be thirsty.
VERSE:Behold, my servants will rejoice,
VERSE:but you will be disappointed.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart,
VERSE:but you will cry for sorrow of heart,
VERSE:and will wail for anguish of spirit.
LABEL:15
VERSE:You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen,
VERSE:and the Lord Yahweh will kill you.
VERSE:He will call his servants by another name,
LABEL:16
VERSE:so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth;
VERSE:and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth;
VERSE:because the former troubles are forgotten,
VERSE:and because they are hidden from my eyes.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;
VERSE:and the former things will not be remembered,
VERSE:nor come into mind.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;
VERSE:for, behold, I create Jerusalem to be a delight,
VERSE:and her people a joy.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
VERSE:and delight in my people;
VERSE:and the voice of weeping and the voice of crying
VERSE:will be heard in her no more.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days,
VERSE:nor an old man who has not filled his days;
VERSE:for the child will die one hundred years old,
VERSE:and the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They will build houses and inhabit them.
VERSE:They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
LABEL:22
VERSE:They will not build and another inhabit.
VERSE:They will not plant and another eat;
VERSE:for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,
VERSE:and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.
LABEL:23
VERSE:They will not labor in vain
VERSE:nor give birth for calamity;
VERSE:for they are the offspring of Yahweh’s blessed
VERSE:and their descendants with them.
LABEL:24
VERSE:It will happen that before they call, I will answer;
VERSE:and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The wolf and the lamb will feed together.
VERSE:The lion will eat straw like the ox.
VERSE:Dust will be the serpent’s food.
VERSE:They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
