CHAPTER:51
TITLE:Isaiah 51
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,
VERSE:you who seek Yahweh.
VERSE:Look to the rock you were cut from,
VERSE:and to the quarry you were dug from.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Look to Abraham your father,
VERSE:and to Sarah who bore you;
VERSE:for when he was but one I called him,
VERSE:I blessed him,
VERSE:and made him many.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For Yahweh has comforted Zion.
VERSE:He has comforted all her waste places,
VERSE:and has made her wilderness like Eden,
VERSE:and her desert like the garden of Yahweh.
VERSE:Joy and gladness will be found in them,
VERSE:thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
LABEL:4
VERSE:“Listen to me, my people;
VERSE:and hear me, my nation,
VERSE:for a law will go out from me,
VERSE:and I will establish my justice for a light to the peoples.
LABEL:5
VERSE:My righteousness is near.
VERSE:My salvation has gone out,
VERSE:and my arms will judge the peoples.
VERSE:The islands will wait for me,
VERSE:and they will trust my arm.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
VERSE:and look at the earth beneath;
VERSE:for the heavens will vanish away like smoke,
VERSE:and the earth will wear out like a garment.
VERSE:Its inhabitants will die in the same way,
VERSE:but my salvation will be forever,
VERSE:and my righteousness will not be abolished.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Listen to me, you who know righteousness,
VERSE:the people in whose heart is my law.
VERSE:Don’t fear the reproach of men,
VERSE:and don’t be dismayed at their insults.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For the moth will eat them up like a garment,
VERSE:and the worm will eat them like wool;
VERSE:but my righteousness will be forever,
VERSE:and my salvation to all generations.”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Yahweh!
VERSE:Awake, as in the days of old,
VERSE:the generations of ancient times.
VERSE:Isn’t it you who cut Rahab in pieces,
VERSE:who pierced the monster?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Isn’t it you who dried up the sea,
VERSE:the waters of the great deep;
VERSE:who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Those ransomed by Yahweh will return,
VERSE:and come with singing to Zion.
VERSE:Everlasting joy shall be on their heads.
VERSE:They will obtain gladness and joy.
VERSE:Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“I, even I, am he who comforts you.
VERSE:Who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die,
VERSE:and of the son of man who will be made as grass?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Have you forgotten Yahweh your Maker,
VERSE:who stretched out the heavens,
VERSE:and laid the foundations of the earth?
VERSE:Do you live in fear continually all day because of the fury of the oppressor,
VERSE:when he prepares to destroy?
VERSE:Where is the fury of the oppressor?
LABEL:14
VERSE:The captive exile will speedily be freed.
VERSE:He will not die and go down into the pit.
VERSE:His bread won’t fail.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea
VERSE:so that its waves roar.
VERSE:Yahweh of Armies is his name.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I have put my words in your mouth
VERSE:and have covered you in the shadow of my hand,
VERSE:that I may plant the heavens,
VERSE:and lay the foundations of the earth,
VERSE:and tell Zion, ‘You are my people.’”
LABEL:17
VERSE:Awake, awake!
VERSE:Stand up, Jerusalem,
VERSE:you who have drunk from Yahweh’s hand the cup of his wrath.
VERSE:You have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering,
VERSE:and drained it.
LABEL:18
VERSE:There is no one to guide her among all the sons to whom she has given birth;
VERSE:and there is no one who takes her by the hand among all the sons whom she has brought up.
LABEL:19
VERSE:These two things have happened to you—
VERSE:who will grieve with you?—
VERSE:desolation and destruction,
VERSE:and famine and the sword.
VERSE:How can I comfort you?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Your sons have fainted.
VERSE:They lie at the head of all the streets,
VERSE:like an antelope in a net.
VERSE:They are full of Yahweh’s wrath,
VERSE:the rebuke of your God.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Therefore now hear this, you afflicted,
VERSE:and drunken, but not with wine:
LABEL:22
VERSE:Your Lord Yahweh,
VERSE:your God who pleads the cause of his people, says,
VERSE:“Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering,
VERSE:even the bowl of the cup of my wrath.
VERSE:You will not drink it any more.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,
VERSE:who have said to your soul, ‘Bow down, that we may walk over you;’
VERSE:and you have laid your back as the ground,
VERSE:like a street to those who walk over.”
