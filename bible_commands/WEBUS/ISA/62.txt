TITLE:Isaiah 62
LABEL:1
VERSE:For Zion’s sake I will not hold my peace,
VERSE:and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,
VERSE:until her righteousness shines out like the dawn,
VERSE:and her salvation like a burning lamp.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The nations will see your righteousness,
VERSE:and all kings your glory.
VERSE:You will be called by a new name,
VERSE:which Yahweh’s mouth will name.
LABEL:3
VERSE:You will also be a crown of beauty in Yahweh’s hand,
VERSE:and a royal diadem in your God’s hand.
LABEL:4
VERSE:You will not be called Forsaken any more,
VERSE:nor will your land be called Desolate any more;
VERSE:but you will be called Hephzibah,
VERSE:and your land Beulah;
VERSE:for Yahweh delights in you,
VERSE:and your land will be married.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For as a young man marries a virgin,
VERSE:so your sons will marry you.
VERSE:As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride,
VERSE:so your God will rejoice over you.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem.
VERSE:They will never be silent day nor night.
VERSE:You who call on Yahweh, take no rest,
LABEL:7
VERSE:and give him no rest until he establishes,
VERSE:and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yahweh has sworn by his right hand,
VERSE:and by the arm of his strength,
VERSE:“Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies,
VERSE:and foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have labored,
LABEL:9
VERSE:but those who have harvested it will eat it, and praise Yahweh.
VERSE:Those who have gathered it will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.”
LABEL:10
VERSE:Go through, go through the gates!
VERSE:Prepare the way of the people!
VERSE:Build up, build up the highway!
VERSE:Gather out the stones!
VERSE:Lift up a banner for the peoples.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth:
VERSE:“Say to the daughter of Zion,
VERSE:‘Behold, your salvation comes!
VERSE:Behold, his reward is with him,
VERSE:and his recompense before him!’”
LABEL:12
VERSE:They will call them “The Holy People,
VERSE:Yahweh’s Redeemed”.
VERSE:You will be called “Sought Out,
VERSE:A City Not Forsaken”.
