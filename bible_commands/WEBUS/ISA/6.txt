CHAPTER:6
TITLE:Isaiah 6
LABEL:1
VERSE:In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.
LABEL:3
VERSE:One called to another, and said,
VERSE:“Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!
VERSE:The whole earth is full of his glory!”
LABEL:4
VERSE:The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!”
LABEL:6
VERSE:Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”
VERSE:Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”
LABEL:9
VERSE:He said, “Go, and tell this people,
VERSE:‘You hear indeed,
VERSE:but don’t understand.
VERSE:You see indeed,
VERSE:but don’t perceive.’
LABEL:10
VERSE:Make the heart of this people fat.
VERSE:Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
VERSE:lest they see with their eyes,
VERSE:hear with their ears,
VERSE:understand with their heart,
VERSE:and turn again, and be healed.”
LABEL:11
VERSE:Then I said, “Lord, how long?”
VERSE:He answered,
VERSE:“Until cities are waste without inhabitant,
VERSE:houses without man,
VERSE:the land becomes utterly waste,
LABEL:12
VERSE:and Yahweh has removed men far away,
VERSE:and the forsaken places are many within the land.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If there is a tenth left in it,
VERSE:that also will in turn be consumed,
VERSE:as a terebinth, and as an oak whose stump remains when they are cut down,
VERSE:so the holy seed is its stump.”
