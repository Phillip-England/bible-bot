TITLE:Isaiah 55
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Hey! Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters!
VERSE:Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat!
VERSE:Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Why do you spend money for that which is not bread,
VERSE:and your labor for that which doesn’t satisfy?
VERSE:Listen diligently to me, and eat that which is good,
VERSE:and let your soul delight itself in richness.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Turn your ear, and come to me.
VERSE:Hear, and your soul will live.
VERSE:I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,
VERSE:a leader and commander to the peoples.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, you shall call a nation that you don’t know;
VERSE:and a nation that didn’t know you shall run to you,
VERSE:because of Yahweh your God,
VERSE:and for the Holy One of Israel;
VERSE:for he has glorified you.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:Seek Yahweh while he may be found.
VERSE:Call on him while he is near.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Let the wicked forsake his way,
VERSE:and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
VERSE:Let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him,
VERSE:to our God, for he will freely pardon.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
VERSE:and your ways are not my ways,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:9
VERSE:“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
VERSE:so are my ways higher than your ways,
VERSE:and my thoughts than your thoughts.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,
VERSE:and doesn’t return there, but waters the earth,
VERSE:and makes it grow and bud,
VERSE:and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
LABEL:11
VERSE:so is my word that goes out of my mouth:
VERSE:it will not return to me void,
VERSE:but it will accomplish that which I please,
VERSE:and it will prosper in the thing I sent it to do.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For you shall go out with joy,
VERSE:and be led out with peace.
VERSE:The mountains and the hills will break out before you into singing;
VERSE:and all the trees of the fields will clap their hands.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Instead of the thorn the cypress tree will come up;
VERSE:and instead of the brier the myrtle tree will come up.
VERSE:It will make a name for Yahweh,
VERSE:for an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.”
