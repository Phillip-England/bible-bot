BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:32
TITLE:Isaiah 32
LABEL:1
VERSE:Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness,
VERSE:and princes shall rule in justice.
LABEL:2
VERSE:A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind,
VERSE:and a covert from the storm,
VERSE:as streams of water in a dry place,
VERSE:as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The eyes of those who see will not be dim,
VERSE:and the ears of those who hear will listen.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The heart of the rash will understand knowledge,
VERSE:and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The fool will no longer be called noble,
VERSE:nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For the fool will speak folly,
VERSE:and his heart will work iniquity,
VERSE:to practice profanity,
VERSE:and to utter error against Yahweh,
VERSE:to make empty the soul of the hungry,
VERSE:and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The ways of the scoundrel are evil.
VERSE:He devises wicked plans to destroy the humble with lying words,
VERSE:even when the needy speaks right.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But the noble devises noble things,
VERSE:and he will continue in noble things.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Rise up, you women who are at ease! Hear my voice!
VERSE:You careless daughters, give ear to my speech!
LABEL:10
VERSE:For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women;
VERSE:for the vintage will fail.
VERSE:The harvest won’t come.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Tremble, you women who are at ease!
VERSE:Be troubled, you careless ones!
VERSE:Strip yourselves, make yourselves naked,
VERSE:and put sackcloth on your waist.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
VERSE:for the fruitful vine.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thorns and briers will come up on my people’s land;
VERSE:yes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For the palace will be forsaken.
VERSE:The populous city will be deserted.
VERSE:The hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever,
VERSE:a delight for wild donkeys,
VERSE:a pasture of flocks,
LABEL:15
VERSE:until the Spirit is poured on us from on high,
VERSE:and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
VERSE:and the fruitful field is considered a forest.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Then justice will dwell in the wilderness;
VERSE:and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The work of righteousness will be peace,
VERSE:and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
LABEL:18
VERSE:My people will live in a peaceful habitation,
VERSE:in safe dwellings,
VERSE:and in quiet resting places,
LABEL:19
VERSE:though hail flattens the forest,
VERSE:and the city is leveled completely.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Blessed are you who sow beside all waters,
VERSE:who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey.
