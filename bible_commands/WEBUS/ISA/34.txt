CHAPTER:34
TITLE:Isaiah 34
LABEL:1
VERSE:Come near, you nations, to hear!
VERSE:Listen, you peoples.
VERSE:Let the earth and all it contains hear,
VERSE:the world, and everything that comes from it.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations,
VERSE:and angry with all their armies.
VERSE:He has utterly destroyed them.
VERSE:He has given them over for slaughter.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Their slain will also be cast out,
VERSE:and the stench of their dead bodies will come up.
VERSE:The mountains will melt in their blood.
LABEL:4
VERSE:All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.
VERSE:The sky will be rolled up like a scroll,
VERSE:and all its armies will fade away,
VERSE:as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.
VERSE:Behold, it will come down on Edom,
VERSE:and on the people of my curse, for judgment.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Yahweh’s sword is filled with blood.
VERSE:It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats,
VERSE:with the fat of the kidneys of rams;
VERSE:for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah,
VERSE:and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The wild oxen will come down with them,
VERSE:and the young bulls with the mighty bulls;
VERSE:and their land will be drunken with blood,
VERSE:and their dust made greasy with fat.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For Yahweh has a day of vengeance,
VERSE:a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Its streams will be turned into pitch,
VERSE:its dust into sulfur,
VERSE:and its land will become burning pitch.
LABEL:10
VERSE:It won’t be quenched night or day.
VERSE:Its smoke will go up forever.
VERSE:From generation to generation, it will lie waste.
VERSE:No one will pass through it forever and ever.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.
VERSE:The owl and the raven will dwell in it.
VERSE:He will stretch the line of confusion over it,
VERSE:and the plumb line of emptiness.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;
VERSE:and all its princes shall be nothing.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thorns will come up in its palaces,
VERSE:nettles and thistles in its fortresses;
VERSE:and it will be a habitation of jackals,
VERSE:a court for ostriches.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,
VERSE:and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.
VERSE:Yes, the night creature shall settle there,
VERSE:and shall find herself a place of rest.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The arrow snake will make her nest there,
VERSE:and lay, hatch, and gather under her shade.
VERSE:Yes, the kites will be gathered there, every one with her mate.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Search in the book of Yahweh, and read:
VERSE:not one of these will be missing.
VERSE:None will lack her mate.
VERSE:For my mouth has commanded,
VERSE:and his Spirit has gathered them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He has cast the lot for them,
VERSE:and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line.
VERSE:They shall possess it forever.
VERSE:From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
