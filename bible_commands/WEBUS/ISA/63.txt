BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:63
TITLE:Isaiah 63
LABEL:1
VERSE:Who is this who comes from Edom,
VERSE:with dyed garments from Bozrah?
VERSE:Who is this who is glorious in his clothing,
VERSE:marching in the greatness of his strength?
VERSE:“It is I who speak in righteousness,
VERSE:mighty to save.”
LABEL:2
VERSE:Why is your clothing red,
VERSE:and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?
LABEL:3
VERSE:“I have trodden the wine press alone.
VERSE:Of the peoples, no one was with me.
VERSE:Yes, I trod them in my anger
VERSE:and trampled them in my wrath.
VERSE:Their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,
VERSE:and I have stained all my clothing.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For the day of vengeance was in my heart,
VERSE:and the year of my redeemed has come.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I looked, and there was no one to help;
VERSE:and I wondered that there was no one to uphold.
VERSE:Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me.
VERSE:My own wrath upheld me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I trod down the peoples in my anger
VERSE:and made them drunk in my wrath.
VERSE:I poured their lifeblood out on the earth.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:I will tell of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh
VERSE:and the praises of Yahweh,
VERSE:according to all that Yahweh has given to us,
VERSE:and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,
VERSE:which he has given to them according to his mercies,
VERSE:and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For he said, “Surely, they are my people,
VERSE:children who will not deal falsely;”
VERSE:so he became their Savior.
LABEL:9
VERSE:In all their affliction he was afflicted,
VERSE:and the angel of his presence saved them.
VERSE:In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.
VERSE:He bore them,
VERSE:and carried them all the days of old.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But they rebelled
VERSE:and grieved his Holy Spirit.
VERSE:Therefore he turned and became their enemy,
VERSE:and he himself fought against them.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Then he remembered the days of old,
VERSE:Moses and his people, saying,
VERSE:“Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock?
VERSE:Where is he who put his Holy Spirit among them?”
LABEL:12
VERSE:Who caused his glorious arm to be at Moses’ right hand?
VERSE:Who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who led them through the depths,
VERSE:like a horse in the wilderness,
VERSE:so that they didn’t stumble?
LABEL:14
VERSE:As the livestock that go down into the valley,
VERSE:Yahweh’s Spirit caused them to rest.
VERSE:So you led your people to make yourself a glorious name.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Look down from heaven,
VERSE:and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory.
VERSE:Where are your zeal and your mighty acts?
VERSE:The yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For you are our Father,
VERSE:though Abraham doesn’t know us,
VERSE:and Israel does not acknowledge us.
VERSE:You, Yahweh, are our Father.
VERSE:Our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
LABEL:17
VERSE:O Yahweh, why do you make us wander from your ways,
VERSE:and harden our heart from your fear?
VERSE:Return for your servants’ sake,
VERSE:the tribes of your inheritance.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Your holy people possessed it but a little while.
VERSE:Our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
LABEL:19
VERSE:We have become like those over whom you never ruled,
VERSE:like those who were not called by your name.
