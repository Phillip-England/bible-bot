VERSE:“Enlarge the place of your tent,
VERSE:and let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations;
VERSE:don’t spare; lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.

VERSE:and your offspring will possess the nations
VERSE:and settle in desolate cities.

VERSE:“Don’t be afraid, for you will not be ashamed.
VERSE:Don’t be confounded, for you will not be disappointed.

VERSE:The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer.

VERSE:“For this is like the waters of Noah to me;
VERSE:for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah will no more go over the earth,
VERSE:so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For the mountains may depart,
VERSE:and the hills be removed,
VERSE:but my loving kindness will not depart from you,
VERSE:and my covenant of peace will not be removed,”
VERSE:says Yahweh who has mercy on you.

VERSE:and far from terror,
VERSE:for it shall not come near you.

VERSE:Behold, they may gather together, but not by me.

VERSE:and forges a weapon for his work;

VERSE:No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;
VERSE:and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment.
VERSE:This is the heritage of Yahweh’s servants,
VERSE:and their righteousness is of me,” says Yahweh.
