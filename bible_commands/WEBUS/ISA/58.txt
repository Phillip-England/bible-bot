BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:58
TITLE:Isaiah 58
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Cry aloud! Don’t spare!
VERSE:Lift up your voice like a trumpet!
VERSE:Declare to my people their disobedience,
VERSE:and to the house of Jacob their sins.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Yet they seek me daily,
VERSE:and delight to know my ways.
VERSE:As a nation that did righteousness,
VERSE:and didn’t forsake the ordinance of their God,
VERSE:they ask of me righteous judgments.
VERSE:They delight to draw near to God.
LABEL:3
VERSE:‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you don’t see?
VERSE:Why have we afflicted our soul, and you don’t notice?’
VERSE:“Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure,
VERSE:and oppress all your laborers.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Behold, you fast for strife and contention,
VERSE:and to strike with the fist of wickedness.
VERSE:You don’t fast today so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Is this the fast that I have chosen?
VERSE:A day for a man to humble his soul?
VERSE:Is it to bow down his head like a reed,
VERSE:and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself?
VERSE:Will you call this a fast,
VERSE:and an acceptable day to Yahweh?
LABEL:6
VERSE:“Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen:
VERSE:to release the bonds of wickedness,
VERSE:to undo the straps of the yoke,
VERSE:to let the oppressed go free,
VERSE:and that you break every yoke?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Isn’t it to distribute your bread to the hungry,
VERSE:and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house?
VERSE:When you see the naked,
VERSE:that you cover him;
VERSE:and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Then your light will break out as the morning,
VERSE:and your healing will appear quickly;
VERSE:then your righteousness shall go before you,
VERSE:and Yahweh’s glory will be your rear guard.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Then you will call, and Yahweh will answer.
VERSE:You will cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’
VERSE:“If you take away from among you the yoke,
VERSE:finger pointing,
VERSE:and speaking wickedly;
LABEL:10
VERSE:and if you pour out your soul to the hungry,
VERSE:and satisfy the afflicted soul,
VERSE:then your light will rise in darkness,
VERSE:and your obscurity will be as the noonday;
LABEL:11
VERSE:and Yahweh will guide you continually,
VERSE:satisfy your soul in dry places,
VERSE:and make your bones strong.
VERSE:You will be like a watered garden,
VERSE:and like a spring of water
VERSE:whose waters don’t fail.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Those who will be of you will build the old waste places.
VERSE:You will raise up the foundations of many generations.
VERSE:You will be called Repairer of the Breach,
VERSE:Restorer of Paths with Dwellings.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,
VERSE:from doing your pleasure on my holy day,
VERSE:and call the Sabbath a delight,
VERSE:and the holy of Yahweh honorable,
VERSE:and honor it,
VERSE:not doing your own ways,
VERSE:nor finding your own pleasure,
VERSE:nor speaking your own words,
LABEL:14
VERSE:then you will delight yourself in Yahweh,
VERSE:and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth,
VERSE:and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father;”
VERSE:for Yahweh’s mouth has spoken it.
