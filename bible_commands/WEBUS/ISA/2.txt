BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Isaiah 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
LABEL:2
VERSE:It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains,
VERSE:and shall be raised above the hills;
VERSE:and all nations shall flow to it.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Many peoples shall go and say,
VERSE:“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
VERSE:to the house of the God of Jacob;
VERSE:and he will teach us of his ways,
VERSE:and we will walk in his paths.”
VERSE:For the law shall go out of Zion,
VERSE:and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He will judge between the nations,
VERSE:and will decide concerning many peoples.
VERSE:They shall beat their swords into plowshares,
VERSE:and their spears into pruning hooks.
VERSE:Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
VERSE:neither shall they learn war any more.
LABEL:5
VERSE:House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of Yahweh.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,
VERSE:because they are filled from the east,
VERSE:with those who practice divination like the Philistines,
VERSE:and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Their land is full of silver and gold,
VERSE:neither is there any end of their treasures.
VERSE:Their land also is full of horses,
VERSE:neither is there any end of their chariots.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Their land also is full of idols.
VERSE:They worship the work of their own hands,
VERSE:that which their own fingers have made.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Man is brought low,
VERSE:and mankind is humbled;
VERSE:therefore don’t forgive them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Enter into the rock,
VERSE:and hide in the dust,
VERSE:from before the terror of Yahweh,
VERSE:and from the glory of his majesty.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The lofty looks of man will be brought low,
VERSE:the arrogance of men will be bowed down,
VERSE:and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and arrogant,
VERSE:and for all that is lifted up,
VERSE:and it shall be brought low—
LABEL:13
VERSE:for all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
VERSE:for all the oaks of Bashan,
LABEL:14
VERSE:for all the high mountains,
VERSE:for all the hills that are lifted up,
LABEL:15
VERSE:for every lofty tower,
VERSE:for every fortified wall,
LABEL:16
VERSE:for all the ships of Tarshish,
VERSE:and for all pleasant imagery.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
VERSE:and the arrogance of men shall be brought low;
VERSE:and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The idols shall utterly pass away.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,
VERSE:and into the holes of the earth,
VERSE:from before the terror of Yahweh,
VERSE:and from the glory of his majesty,
VERSE:when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver
VERSE:and their idols of gold,
VERSE:which have been made for themselves to worship,
VERSE:to the moles and to the bats,
LABEL:21
VERSE:to go into the caverns of the rocks,
VERSE:and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
VERSE:from before the terror of Yahweh,
VERSE:and from the glory of his majesty,
VERSE:when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
VERSE:for of what account is he?
