BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Isaiah 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.
VERSE:My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He dug it up,
VERSE:gathered out its stones,
VERSE:planted it with the choicest vine,
VERSE:built a tower in the middle of it,
VERSE:and also cut out a wine press in it.
VERSE:He looked for it to yield grapes,
VERSE:but it yielded wild grapes.
LABEL:3
VERSE:“Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
VERSE:please judge between me and my vineyard.
LABEL:4
VERSE:What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?
VERSE:Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
VERSE:I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.
VERSE:I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I will lay it a wasteland.
VERSE:It won’t be pruned or hoed,
VERSE:but it will grow briers and thorns.
VERSE:I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,
VERSE:and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.
VERSE:He looked for justice, but behold, oppression,
VERSE:for righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Woe to those who join house to house,
VERSE:who lay field to field, until there is no room,
VERSE:and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!
LABEL:9
VERSE:In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says: “Surely many houses will be desolate,
VERSE:even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,
VERSE:and a homer of seed shall yield an ephah.”
LABEL:11
VERSE:Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink,
VERSE:who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!
LABEL:12
VERSE:The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;
VERSE:but they don’t respect the work of Yahweh,
VERSE:neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
VERSE:Their honorable men are famished,
VERSE:and their multitudes are parched with thirst.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire,
VERSE:and opened its mouth without measure;
VERSE:and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.
LABEL:15
VERSE:So man is brought low,
VERSE:mankind is humbled,
VERSE:and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;
LABEL:16
VERSE:but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice,
VERSE:and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,
VERSE:and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
VERSE:and wickedness as with cart rope,
LABEL:19
VERSE:who say, “Let him make haste, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;
VERSE:let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,
VERSE:that we may know it!”
LABEL:20
VERSE:Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;
VERSE:who put darkness for light,
VERSE:and light for darkness;
VERSE:who put bitter for sweet,
VERSE:and sweet for bitter!
LABEL:21
VERSE:Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,
VERSE:and prudent in their own sight!
LABEL:22
VERSE:Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,
VERSE:and champions at mixing strong drink;
LABEL:23
VERSE:who acquit the guilty for a bribe,
VERSE:but deny justice for the innocent!
LABEL:24
VERSE:Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
VERSE:and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,
VERSE:so their root shall be as rottenness,
VERSE:and their blossom shall go up as dust,
VERSE:because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,
VERSE:and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh’s anger burns against his people,
VERSE:and he has stretched out his hand against them and has struck them.
VERSE:The mountains tremble,
VERSE:and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets.
VERSE:For all this, his anger is not turned away,
VERSE:but his hand is still stretched out.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He will lift up a banner to the nations from far away,
VERSE:and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.
VERSE:Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.
LABEL:27
VERSE:No one shall be weary nor stumble among them;
VERSE:no one shall slumber nor sleep,
VERSE:neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,
VERSE:nor the strap of their sandals be broken,
LABEL:28
VERSE:whose arrows are sharp,
VERSE:and all their bows bent.
VERSE:Their horses’ hoofs will be like flint,
VERSE:and their wheels like a whirlwind.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Their roaring will be like a lioness.
VERSE:They will roar like young lions.
VERSE:Yes, they shall roar,
VERSE:and seize their prey and carry it off,
VERSE:and there will be no one to deliver.
LABEL:30
VERSE:They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.
VERSE:If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress.
VERSE:The light is darkened in its clouds.
