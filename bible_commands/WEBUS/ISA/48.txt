CHAPTER:48
TITLE:Isaiah 48
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Hear this, house of Jacob,
VERSE:you who are called by the name of Israel,
VERSE:and have come out of the waters of Judah.
VERSE:You swear by Yahweh’s name,
VERSE:and make mention of the God of Israel,
VERSE:but not in truth, nor in righteousness—
LABEL:2
VERSE:for they call themselves citizens of the holy city,
VERSE:and rely on the God of Israel;
VERSE:Yahweh of Armies is his name.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have declared the former things from of old.
VERSE:Yes, they went out of my mouth, and I revealed them.
VERSE:I did them suddenly, and they happened.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Because I knew that you are obstinate,
VERSE:and your neck is an iron sinew,
VERSE:and your brow bronze;
LABEL:5
VERSE:therefore I have declared it to you from of old;
VERSE:before it came to pass I showed it to you;
VERSE:lest you should say, ‘My idol has done them.
VERSE:My engraved image and my molten image has commanded them.’
LABEL:6
VERSE:You have heard it.
VERSE:Now see all this.
VERSE:And you, won’t you declare it?
VERSE:“I have shown you new things from this time,
VERSE:even hidden things, which you have not known.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They are created now, and not from of old.
VERSE:Before today, you didn’t hear them,
VERSE:lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’
LABEL:8
VERSE:Yes, you didn’t hear.
VERSE:Yes, you didn’t know.
VERSE:Yes, from of old your ear was not opened,
VERSE:for I knew that you dealt very treacherously,
VERSE:and were called a transgressor from the womb.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For my name’s sake, I will defer my anger,
VERSE:and for my praise, I hold it back for you
VERSE:so that I don’t cut you off.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Behold, I have refined you,
VERSE:but not as silver.
VERSE:I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For my own sake,
VERSE:for my own sake, I will do it;
VERSE:for how would my name be profaned?
VERSE:I will not give my glory to another.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Listen to me, O Jacob,
VERSE:and Israel my called:
VERSE:I am he.
VERSE:I am the first.
VERSE:I am also the last.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth,
VERSE:and my right hand has spread out the heavens.
VERSE:when I call to them, they stand up together.
LABEL:14
VERSE:“Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear!
VERSE:Who among them has declared these things?
VERSE:He whom Yahweh loves will do what he likes to Babylon,
VERSE:and his arm will be against the Chaldeans.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I, even I, have spoken.
VERSE:Yes, I have called him.
VERSE:I have brought him
VERSE:and he shall make his way prosperous.
LABEL:16
VERSE:“Come near to me and hear this:
VERSE:“From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;
VERSE:from the time that it happened, I was there.”
VERSE:Now the Lord Yahweh has sent me
VERSE:with his Spirit.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Yahweh,
VERSE:your Redeemer,
VERSE:the Holy One of Israel, says:
VERSE:“I am Yahweh your God,
VERSE:who teaches you to profit,
VERSE:who leads you by the way that you should go.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Oh that you had listened to my commandments!
VERSE:Then your peace would have been like a river
VERSE:and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Your offspring also would have been as the sand
VERSE:and the descendants of your body like its grains.
VERSE:His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.”
LABEL:20
VERSE:Leave Babylon!
VERSE:Flee from the Chaldeans!
VERSE:With the sound of joyful shouting announce this,
VERSE:tell it even to the end of the earth;
VERSE:say, “Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob!”
LABEL:21
VERSE:They didn’t thirst when he led them through the deserts.
VERSE:He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them.
VERSE:He also split the rock and the waters gushed out.
LABEL:22
VERSE:“There is no peace”, says Yahweh, “for the wicked.”
