CHAPTER:43
TITLE:Isaiah 43
LABEL:1
VERSE:But now Yahweh who created you, Jacob,
VERSE:and he who formed you, Israel, says:
VERSE:“Don’t be afraid, for I have redeemed you.
VERSE:I have called you by your name.
VERSE:You are mine.
LABEL:2
VERSE:When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,
VERSE:and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
VERSE:When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,
VERSE:and flame will not scorch you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I am Yahweh your God,
VERSE:the Holy One of Israel,
VERSE:your Savior.
VERSE:I have given Egypt as your ransom,
VERSE:Ethiopia and Seba in your place.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Since you have been precious and honored in my sight,
VERSE:and I have loved you,
VERSE:therefore I will give people in your place,
VERSE:and nations instead of your life.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.
VERSE:I will bring your offspring from the east,
VERSE:and gather you from the west.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I will tell the north, ‘Give them up!’
VERSE:and tell the south, ‘Don’t hold them back!
VERSE:Bring my sons from far away,
VERSE:and my daughters from the ends of the earth—
LABEL:7
VERSE:everyone who is called by my name,
VERSE:and whom I have created for my glory,
VERSE:whom I have formed,
VERSE:yes, whom I have made.’”
LABEL:8
VERSE:Bring out the blind people who have eyes,
VERSE:and the deaf who have ears.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let all the nations be gathered together,
VERSE:and let the peoples be assembled.
VERSE:Who among them can declare this,
VERSE:and show us former things?
VERSE:Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified,
VERSE:or let them hear, and say, “That is true.”
LABEL:10
VERSE:“You are my witnesses,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“With my servant whom I have chosen;
VERSE:that you may know and believe me,
VERSE:and understand that I am he.
VERSE:Before me there was no God formed,
VERSE:neither will there be after me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I myself am Yahweh.
VERSE:Besides me, there is no savior.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown,
VERSE:and there was no strange god among you.
VERSE:Therefore you are my witnesses”,
VERSE:says Yahweh, “and I am God.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yes, since the day was, I am he.
VERSE:There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
VERSE:I will work, and who can hinder it?”
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says: “For your sake, I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring all of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yahweh, who makes a way in the sea,
VERSE:and a path in the mighty waters,
LABEL:17
VERSE:who brings out the chariot and horse,
VERSE:the army and the mighty man
VERSE:(they lie down together, they shall not rise;
VERSE:they are extinct, they are quenched like a wick) says:
LABEL:18
VERSE:“Don’t remember the former things,
VERSE:and don’t consider the things of old.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Behold, I will do a new thing.
VERSE:It springs out now.
VERSE:Don’t you know it?
VERSE:I will even make a way in the wilderness,
VERSE:and rivers in the desert.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The animals of the field, the jackals and the ostriches, shall honor me,
VERSE:because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert,
VERSE:to give drink to my people, my chosen,
LABEL:21
VERSE:the people which I formed for myself,
VERSE:that they might declare my praise.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yet you have not called on me, Jacob;
VERSE:but you have been weary of me, Israel.
LABEL:23
VERSE:You have not brought me any of your sheep for burnt offerings,
VERSE:neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.
VERSE:I have not burdened you with offerings,
VERSE:nor wearied you with frankincense.
LABEL:24
VERSE:You have bought me no sweet cane with money,
VERSE:nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices,
VERSE:but you have burdened me with your sins.
VERSE:You have wearied me with your iniquities.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;
VERSE:and I will not remember your sins.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Put me in remembrance.
VERSE:Let us plead together.
VERSE:Declare your case,
VERSE:that you may be justified.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Your first father sinned,
VERSE:and your teachers have transgressed against me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;
VERSE:and I will make Jacob a curse,
VERSE:and Israel an insult.”
