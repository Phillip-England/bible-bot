LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh says:
VERSE:“Maintain justice
VERSE:and do what is right,
VERSE:for my salvation is near
VERSE:and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Blessed is the man who does this,
VERSE:and the son of man who holds it fast;
VERSE:who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it
VERSE:and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
LABEL:3
VERSE:Let no foreigner who has joined himself to Yahweh speak, saying,
VERSE:“Yahweh will surely separate me from his people.”
VERSE:Do not let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:For Yahweh says, “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
VERSE:choose the things that please me,
VERSE:and hold fast to my covenant,
LABEL:5
VERSE:I will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters.
VERSE:I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh
VERSE:to serve him,
VERSE:and to love Yahweh’s name,
VERSE:to be his servants,
VERSE:everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it,
VERSE:and holds fast my covenant,
LABEL:7
VERSE:I will bring these to my holy mountain,
VERSE:and make them joyful in my house of prayer.
VERSE:Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar;
VERSE:for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says,
VERSE:“I will yet gather others to him,
VERSE:in addition to his own who are gathered.”

VERSE:All you animals of the field,
VERSE:come to devour,
VERSE:all you animals in the forest.

VERSE:His watchmen are blind.
VERSE:They are all without knowledge.
VERSE:They are all mute dogs.
VERSE:They can’t bark—
VERSE:dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Yes, the dogs are greedy.
VERSE:They can never have enough.
VERSE:They are shepherds who can’t understand.
VERSE:They have all turned to their own way,
VERSE:each one to his gain, from every quarter.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Come,” they say, “I will get wine,
VERSE:and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;
VERSE:and tomorrow will be as today,
VERSE:great beyond measure.”
