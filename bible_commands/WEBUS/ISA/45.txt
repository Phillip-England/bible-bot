CHAPTER:45
TITLE:Isaiah 45
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held to subdue nations before him and strip kings of their armor, to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut:
LABEL:2
VERSE:“I will go before you
VERSE:and make the rough places smooth.
VERSE:I will break the doors of bronze in pieces
VERSE:and cut apart the bars of iron.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I will give you the treasures of darkness
VERSE:and hidden riches of secret places,
VERSE:that you may know that it is I, Yahweh, who calls you by your name,
VERSE:even the God of Israel.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For Jacob my servant’s sake,
VERSE:and Israel my chosen,
VERSE:I have called you by your name.
VERSE:I have given you a title,
VERSE:though you have not known me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I am Yahweh, and there is no one else.
VERSE:Besides me, there is no God.
VERSE:I will strengthen you,
VERSE:though you have not known me,
LABEL:6
VERSE:that they may know from the rising of the sun,
VERSE:and from the west,
VERSE:that there is no one besides me.
VERSE:I am Yahweh, and there is no one else.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I form the light
VERSE:and create darkness.
VERSE:I make peace
VERSE:and create calamity.
VERSE:I am Yahweh,
VERSE:who does all these things.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Rain, you heavens, from above,
VERSE:and let the skies pour down righteousness.
VERSE:Let the earth open, that it may produce salvation,
VERSE:and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it.
VERSE:I, Yahweh, have created it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Woe to him who strives with his Maker—
VERSE:a clay pot among the clay pots of the earth!
VERSE:Shall the clay ask him who fashions it, ‘What are you making?’
VERSE:or your work, ‘He has no hands’?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What have you become the father of?’
VERSE:or to a mother, ‘What have you given birth to?’”
LABEL:11
VERSE:Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel
VERSE:and his Maker says:
VERSE:“You ask me about the things that are to come, concerning my sons,
VERSE:and you command me concerning the work of my hands!
LABEL:12
VERSE:I have made the earth, and created man on it.
VERSE:I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens.
VERSE:I have commanded all their army.
LABEL:13
VERSE:I have raised him up in righteousness,
VERSE:and I will make all his ways straight.
VERSE:He shall build my city,
VERSE:and he shall let my exiles go free,
VERSE:not for price nor reward,” says Yahweh of Armies.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yahweh says: “The labor of Egypt,
VERSE:and the merchandise of Ethiopia,
VERSE:and the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you,
VERSE:and they will be yours.
VERSE:They will go after you.
VERSE:They shall come over in chains.
VERSE:They will bow down to you.
VERSE:They will make supplication to you:
VERSE:‘Surely God is in you; and there is no one else.
VERSE:There is no other god.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Most certainly you are a God who has hidden yourself,
VERSE:God of Israel, the Savior.’”
LABEL:16
VERSE:They will be disappointed,
VERSE:yes, confounded, all of them.
VERSE:Those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Israel will be saved by Yahweh with an everlasting salvation.
VERSE:You will not be disappointed nor confounded to ages everlasting.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For Yahweh who created the heavens,
VERSE:the God who formed the earth and made it,
VERSE:who established it and didn’t create it a waste,
VERSE:who formed it to be inhabited says:
VERSE:“I am Yahweh.
VERSE:There is no other.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I have not spoken in secret,
VERSE:in a place of the land of darkness.
VERSE:I didn’t say to the offspring of Jacob, ‘Seek me in vain.’
VERSE:I, Yahweh, speak righteousness.
VERSE:I declare things that are right.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“Assemble yourselves and come.
VERSE:Draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations.
VERSE:Those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image,
VERSE:and pray to a god that can’t save.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Declare and present it.
VERSE:Yes, let them take counsel together.
VERSE:Who has shown this from ancient time?
VERSE:Who has declared it of old?
VERSE:Haven’t I, Yahweh?
VERSE:There is no other God besides me, a just God and a Savior.
VERSE:There is no one besides me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:“Look to me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth;
VERSE:for I am God, and there is no other.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I have sworn by myself.
VERSE:The word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and will not be revoked,
VERSE:that to me every knee shall bow,
VERSE:every tongue shall take an oath.
LABEL:24
VERSE:They will say of me,
VERSE:‘There is righteousness and strength only in Yahweh.’”
VERSE:Even to him will men come.
VERSE:All those who raged against him will be disappointed.
LABEL:25
VERSE:All the offspring of Israel will be justified in Yahweh,
VERSE:and will rejoice!
