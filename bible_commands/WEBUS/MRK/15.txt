CHAPTER:15
TITLE:Mark 15
LABEL:1
VERSE:Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
VERSE:He answered, “So you say.”
LABEL:3
VERSE:The chief priests accused him of many things.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”
LABEL:5
VERSE:But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him.
LABEL:7
VERSE:There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
LABEL:10
VERSE:For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”
LABEL:13
VERSE:They cried out again, “Crucify him!”
LABEL:14
VERSE:Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”
VERSE:But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”
LABEL:15
VERSE:Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They clothed him with purple; and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
LABEL:19
VERSE:They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.
LABEL:20
VERSE:When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross.
LABEL:22
VERSE:They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”
LABEL:23
VERSE:They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.
LABEL:25
VERSE:It was the third hour when they crucified him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The superscription of his accusation was written over him: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
LABEL:27
VERSE:With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”
LABEL:29
VERSE:Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,
LABEL:30
VERSE:save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
LABEL:31
VERSE:Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.” Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.
LABEL:33
VERSE:When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
LABEL:34
VERSE:At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
LABEL:35
VERSE:Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”
LABEL:36
VERSE:One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”
LABEL:37
VERSE:Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
LABEL:38
VERSE:The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
LABEL:39
VERSE:When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
LABEL:40
VERSE:There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
LABEL:41
VERSE:who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
LABEL:42
VERSE:When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
LABEL:43
VERSE:Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.
LABEL:45
VERSE:When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
LABEL:46
VERSE:He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
LABEL:47
VERSE:Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
