CHAPTER:2
TITLE:1 Timothy 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men,
LABEL:2
VERSE:for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
LABEL:4
VERSE:who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
LABEL:6
VERSE:who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,
LABEL:7
VERSE:to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.
LABEL:9
VERSE:In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,
LABEL:10
VERSE:but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;
LABEL:15
VERSE:but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.
