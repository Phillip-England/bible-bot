VERSE:“Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
LABEL:2
VERSE:and say,
VERSE:‘What was your mother?
VERSE:A lioness.
VERSE:She couched among lions,
VERSE:in the middle of the young lions she nourished her cubs.

VERSE:She brought up one of her cubs.
VERSE:He became a young lion.
VERSE:He learned to catch the prey.

VERSE:The nations also heard of him.

VERSE:and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.

VERSE:“‘Now when she saw that she had waited,
VERSE:and her hope was lost,
VERSE:then she took another of her cubs,
VERSE:and made him a young lion.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He went up and down among the lions.
VERSE:He became a young lion.
VERSE:He learned to catch the prey.
VERSE:He devoured men.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He knew their palaces,
VERSE:and laid waste their cities.
VERSE:The land was desolate with its fullness,
VERSE:because of the noise of his roaring.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Then the nations attacked him on every side from the provinces.
VERSE:They spread their net over him.
VERSE:He was taken in their pit.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They put him in a cage with hooks,
VERSE:and brought him to the king of Babylon.

VERSE:“‘Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters.
VERSE:It was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
LABEL:11
VERSE:It had strong branches for the scepters of those who ruled.
VERSE:Their stature was exalted among the thick boughs.
VERSE:They were seen in their height
VERSE:with the multitude of their branches.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But it was plucked up in fury.
VERSE:It was cast down to the ground,
VERSE:and the east wind dried up its fruit.
VERSE:Its strong branches were broken off and withered.
VERSE:The fire consumed them.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Now it is planted in the wilderness,
VERSE:in a dry and thirsty land.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Fire has gone out of its branches.
VERSE:It has devoured its fruit,
VERSE:so that there is in it no strong branch to be a scepter to rule.’
VERSE:This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.”
