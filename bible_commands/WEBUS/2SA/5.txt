VERSE:So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel.

VERSE:The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “The blind and the lame will keep you out of here,” thinking, “David can’t come in here.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. This is David’s city.
LABEL:8
VERSE:David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.”

VERSE:Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

VERSE:David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?”
VERSE:Yahweh said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.”

VERSE:David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. Then he said, “Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.

VERSE:When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”

VERSE:David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer.
