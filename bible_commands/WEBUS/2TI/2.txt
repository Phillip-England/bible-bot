BOOK:2TI
CHAPTER:2
TITLE:2 Timothy 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
LABEL:3
VERSE:You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
LABEL:4
VERSE:No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of David, according to my Good News,
LABEL:9
VERSE:in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
LABEL:11
VERSE:This saying is trustworthy:
VERSE:“For if we died with him,
VERSE:we will also live with him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If we endure,
VERSE:we will also reign with him.
VERSE:If we deny him,
VERSE:he also will deny us.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If we are faithless,
VERSE:he remains faithful;
VERSE:for he can’t deny himself.”
LABEL:14
VERSE:Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,
LABEL:17
VERSE:and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus:
LABEL:18
VERSE:men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.
LABEL:19
VERSE:However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”
LABEL:20
VERSE:Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor.
LABEL:21
VERSE:If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
LABEL:23
VERSE:But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient,
LABEL:25
VERSE:in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,
LABEL:26
VERSE:and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will.
