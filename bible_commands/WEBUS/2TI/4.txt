CHAPTER:4
TITLE:2 Timothy 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:
LABEL:2
VERSE:preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts,
LABEL:4
VERSE:and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.
LABEL:8
VERSE:From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Be diligent to come to me soon,
LABEL:10
VERSE:for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you comeâ€”and the books, especially the parchments.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words.
LABEL:16
VERSE:At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
