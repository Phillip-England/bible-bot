CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Joel 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:“For, behold, in those days,
VERSE:and in that time,
VERSE:when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
LABEL:2
VERSE:I will gather all nations,
VERSE:and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;
VERSE:and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,
VERSE:and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.
VERSE:They have divided my land,
LABEL:3
VERSE:and have cast lots for my people,
VERSE:and have given a boy for a prostitute,
VERSE:and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
LABEL:4
VERSE:“Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon,
VERSE:and all the regions of Philistia?
VERSE:Will you repay me?
VERSE:And if you repay me,
VERSE:I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Because you have taken my silver and my gold,
VERSE:and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,
LABEL:6
VERSE:and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,
VERSE:that you may remove them far from their border.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,
VERSE:and will return your repayment on your own head;
LABEL:8
VERSE:and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,
VERSE:and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,
VERSE:to a faraway nation,
VERSE:for Yahweh has spoken it.”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Proclaim this among the nations:
VERSE:“Prepare for war!
VERSE:Stir up the mighty men.
VERSE:Let all the warriors draw near.
VERSE:Let them come up.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Beat your plowshares into swords,
VERSE:and your pruning hooks into spears.
VERSE:Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’
LABEL:11
VERSE:Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,
VERSE:and gather yourselves together.”
VERSE:Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Let the nations arouse themselves,
VERSE:and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;
VERSE:for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Put in the sickle;
VERSE:for the harvest is ripe.
VERSE:Come, tread, for the wine press is full,
VERSE:the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”
LABEL:14
VERSE:Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!
VERSE:For the day of Yahweh is near in the valley of decision.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The sun and the moon are darkened,
VERSE:and the stars withdraw their shining.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yahweh will roar from Zion,
VERSE:and thunder from Jerusalem;
VERSE:and the heavens and the earth will shake;
VERSE:but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,
VERSE:and a stronghold to the children of Israel.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,
VERSE:dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.
VERSE:Then Jerusalem will be holy,
VERSE:and no strangers will pass through her any more.
LABEL:18
VERSE:It will happen in that day,
VERSE:that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,
VERSE:the hills will flow with milk,
VERSE:all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters;
VERSE:and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house,
VERSE:and will water the valley of Shittim.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Egypt will be a desolation
VERSE:and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
VERSE:for the violence done to the children of Judah,
VERSE:because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
LABEL:20
VERSE:But Judah will be inhabited forever,
VERSE:and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
LABEL:21
VERSE:I will cleanse their blood
VERSE:that I have not cleansed,
VERSE:for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”
