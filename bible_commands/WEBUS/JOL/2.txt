BOOK:JOL
CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Joel 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:Blow the trumpet in Zion,
VERSE:and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!
VERSE:Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
VERSE:for the day of Yahweh comes,
VERSE:for it is close at hand:
LABEL:2
VERSE:A day of darkness and gloominess,
VERSE:a day of clouds and thick darkness.
VERSE:As the dawn spreading on the mountains,
VERSE:a great and strong people;
VERSE:there has never been the like,
VERSE:neither will there be any more after them,
VERSE:even to the years of many generations.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A fire devours before them,
VERSE:and behind them, a flame burns.
VERSE:The land is as the garden of Eden before them,
VERSE:and behind them, a desolate wilderness.
VERSE:Yes, and no one has escaped them.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,
VERSE:and they run as horsemen.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap,
VERSE:like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,
VERSE:like a strong people set in battle array.
LABEL:6
VERSE:At their presence the peoples are in anguish.
VERSE:All faces have grown pale.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They run like mighty men.
VERSE:They climb the wall like warriors.
VERSE:They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.
LABEL:8
VERSE:One doesn’t jostle another.
VERSE:They each march in their own path.
VERSE:They burst through the defenses
VERSE:and don’t break ranks.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They rush on the city.
VERSE:They run on the wall.
VERSE:They climb up into the houses.
VERSE:They enter in at the windows like thieves.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The earth quakes before them.
VERSE:The heavens tremble.
VERSE:The sun and the moon are darkened,
VERSE:and the stars withdraw their shining.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Yahweh thunders his voice before his army,
VERSE:for his forces are very great;
VERSE:for he is strong who obeys his command;
VERSE:for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,
VERSE:and who can endure it?
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,
VERSE:and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”
LABEL:13
VERSE:Tear your heart and not your garments,
VERSE:and turn to Yahweh, your God;
VERSE:for he is gracious and merciful,
VERSE:slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
VERSE:and relents from sending calamity.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Who knows? He may turn and relent,
VERSE:and leave a blessing behind him,
VERSE:even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Blow the trumpet in Zion!
VERSE:Sanctify a fast.
VERSE:Call a solemn assembly.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Gather the people.
VERSE:Sanctify the assembly.
VERSE:Assemble the elders.
VERSE:Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.
VERSE:Let the bridegroom go out of his room,
VERSE:and the bride out of her chamber.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,
VERSE:and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,
VERSE:and don’t give your heritage to reproach,
VERSE:that the nations should rule over them.
VERSE:Why should they say among the peoples,
VERSE:‘Where is their God?’”
LABEL:18
VERSE:Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,
VERSE:and had pity on his people.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Yahweh answered his people,
VERSE:“Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,
VERSE:and you will be satisfied with them;
VERSE:and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
LABEL:20
VERSE:But I will remove the northern army far away from you,
VERSE:and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,
VERSE:its front into the eastern sea,
VERSE:and its back into the western sea;
VERSE:and its stench will come up,
VERSE:and its bad smell will rise.”
VERSE:Surely he has done great things.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Land, don’t be afraid.
VERSE:Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;
VERSE:for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,
VERSE:for the tree bears its fruit.
VERSE:The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.
LABEL:23
VERSE:“Be glad then, you children of Zion,
VERSE:and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;
VERSE:for he gives you the early rain in just measure,
VERSE:and he causes the rain to come down for you,
VERSE:the early rain and the latter rain, as before.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The threshing floors will be full of wheat,
VERSE:and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,
VERSE:the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,
VERSE:my great army, which I sent among you.
LABEL:26
VERSE:You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied,
VERSE:and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,
VERSE:who has dealt wondrously with you;
VERSE:and my people will never again be disappointed.
LABEL:27
VERSE:You will know that I am among Israel,
VERSE:and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else;
VERSE:and my people will never again be disappointed.
LABEL:28
VERSE:“It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;
VERSE:and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
VERSE:Your old men will dream dreams.
VERSE:Your young men will see visions.
LABEL:29
VERSE:And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,
VERSE:I will pour out my Spirit.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:
VERSE:blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.
LABEL:31
VERSE:The sun will be turned into darkness,
VERSE:and the moon into blood,
VERSE:before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.
LABEL:32
VERSE:It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved;
VERSE:for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,
VERSE:as Yahweh has said,
VERSE:and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.
