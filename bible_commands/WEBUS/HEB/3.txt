CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Hebrews 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus,
LABEL:2
VERSE:who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,
LABEL:6
VERSE:but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,
VERSE:“Today if you will hear his voice,
LABEL:8
VERSE:don’t harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
VERSE:in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
LABEL:9
VERSE:where your fathers tested me and tried me,
VERSE:and saw my deeds for forty years.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore I was displeased with that generation,
VERSE:and said, ‘They always err in their heart,
VERSE:but they didn’t know my ways.’
LABEL:11
VERSE:As I swore in my wrath,
VERSE:‘They will not enter into my rest.’”
LABEL:12
VERSE:Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;
LABEL:13
VERSE:but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,
LABEL:15
VERSE:while it is said,
VERSE:“Today if you will hear his voice,
VERSE:don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:For who, when they heard, rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?
LABEL:17
VERSE:With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
LABEL:18
VERSE:To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
LABEL:19
VERSE:We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief.
