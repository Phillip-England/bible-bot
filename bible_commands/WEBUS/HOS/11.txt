CHAPTER:11
TITLE:Hosea 11
LABEL:1
VERSE:“When Israel was a child, then I loved him,
VERSE:and called my son out of Egypt.
LABEL:2
VERSE:They called to them, so they went from them.
VERSE:They sacrificed to the Baals,
VERSE:and burned incense to engraved images.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Yet I taught Ephraim to walk.
VERSE:I took them by their arms,
VERSE:but they didn’t know that I healed them.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love;
VERSE:and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks;
VERSE:and I bent down to him and I fed him.
LABEL:5
VERSE:“They won’t return into the land of Egypt;
VERSE:but the Assyrian will be their king,
VERSE:because they refused to repent.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The sword will fall on their cities,
VERSE:and will destroy the bars of their gates,
VERSE:and will put an end to their plans.
LABEL:7
VERSE:My people are determined to turn from me.
VERSE:Though they call to the Most High,
VERSE:he certainly won’t exalt them.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“How can I give you up, Ephraim?
VERSE:How can I hand you over, Israel?
VERSE:How can I make you like Admah?
VERSE:How can I make you like Zeboiim?
VERSE:My heart is turned within me,
VERSE:my compassion is aroused.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I will not execute the fierceness of my anger.
VERSE:I will not return to destroy Ephraim,
VERSE:for I am God, and not man—the Holy One among you.
VERSE:I will not come in wrath.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They will walk after Yahweh,
VERSE:who will roar like a lion;
VERSE:for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt,
VERSE:and like a dove out of the land of Assyria;
VERSE:and I will settle them in their houses,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood,
VERSE:and the house of Israel with deceit.
VERSE:Judah still strays from God,
VERSE:and is unfaithful to the Holy One.
