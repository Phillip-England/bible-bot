CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Hosea 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Listen to this, you priests!
VERSE:Listen, house of Israel,
VERSE:and give ear, house of the king!
VERSE:For the judgment is against you;
VERSE:for you have been a snare at Mizpah,
VERSE:and a net spread on Tabor.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The rebels are deep in slaughter,
VERSE:but I discipline all of them.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I know Ephraim,
VERSE:and Israel is not hidden from me;
VERSE:for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.
VERSE:Israel is defiled.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God,
VERSE:for the spirit of prostitution is within them,
VERSE:and they don’t know Yahweh.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The pride of Israel testifies to his face.
VERSE:Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.
VERSE:Judah also will stumble with them.
LABEL:6
VERSE:They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh,
VERSE:but they won’t find him.
VERSE:He has withdrawn himself from them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They are unfaithful to Yahweh;
VERSE:for they have borne illegitimate children.
VERSE:Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.
LABEL:8
VERSE:“Blow the cornet in Gibeah,
VERSE:and the trumpet in Ramah!
VERSE:Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!
LABEL:9
VERSE:Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.
VERSE:Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.
VERSE:I will pour out my wrath on them like water.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Ephraim is oppressed,
VERSE:he is crushed in judgment,
VERSE:because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,
VERSE:and to the house of Judah like rottenness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“When Ephraim saw his sickness,
VERSE:and Judah his wound,
VERSE:then Ephraim went to Assyria,
VERSE:and sent to King Jareb:
VERSE:but he is not able to heal you,
VERSE:neither will he cure you of your wound.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,
VERSE:and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
VERSE:I myself will tear in pieces and go away.
VERSE:I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I will go and return to my place,
VERSE:until they acknowledge their offense,
VERSE:and seek my face.
VERSE:In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”
