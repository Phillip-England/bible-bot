BOOK:HOS
CHAPTER:9
TITLE:Hosea 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:Don’t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;
VERSE:for you were unfaithful to your God.
VERSE:You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them,
VERSE:and the new wine will fail her.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land;
VERSE:but Ephraim will return to Egypt,
VERSE:and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh,
VERSE:neither will they be pleasing to him.
VERSE:Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;
VERSE:all who eat of it will be polluted;
VERSE:for their bread will be for their appetite.
VERSE:It will not come into Yahweh’s house.
LABEL:5
VERSE:What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,
VERSE:and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?
LABEL:6
VERSE:For, behold, when they flee destruction,
VERSE:Egypt will gather them up.
VERSE:Memphis will bury them.
VERSE:Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.
VERSE:Thorns will be in their tents.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The days of visitation have come.
VERSE:The days of reckoning have come.
VERSE:Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,
VERSE:and the man who is inspired to be insane,
VERSE:because of the abundance of your sins,
VERSE:and because your hostility is great.
LABEL:8
VERSE:A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.
VERSE:A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths,
VERSE:and hostility in the house of his God.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They have deeply corrupted themselves,
VERSE:as in the days of Gibeah.
VERSE:He will remember their iniquity.
VERSE:He will punish them for their sins.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.
VERSE:I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;
VERSE:but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,
VERSE:and became abominable like that which they loved.
LABEL:11
VERSE:As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.
VERSE:There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Though they bring up their children,
VERSE:yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.
VERSE:Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!
LABEL:13
VERSE:I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;
VERSE:but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Give them—Yahweh what will you give?
VERSE:Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
LABEL:15
VERSE:“All their wickedness is in Gilgal;
VERSE:for there I hated them.
VERSE:Because of the wickedness of their deeds, I will drive them out of my house!
VERSE:I will love them no more.
VERSE:All their princes are rebels.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Ephraim is struck.
VERSE:Their root has dried up.
VERSE:They will bear no fruit.
VERSE:Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.”
LABEL:17
VERSE:My God will cast them away, because they didn’t listen to him;
VERSE:and they will be wanderers among the nations.
