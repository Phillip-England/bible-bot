CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Hosea 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’
VERSE:and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’
LABEL:2
VERSE:Contend with your mother!
VERSE:Contend, for she is not my wife,
VERSE:neither am I her husband;
VERSE:and let her put away her prostitution from her face,
VERSE:and her adulteries from between her breasts;
LABEL:3
VERSE:lest I strip her naked,
VERSE:and make her bare as in the day that she was born,
VERSE:and make her like a wilderness,
VERSE:and set her like a dry land,
VERSE:and kill her with thirst.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy,
VERSE:for they are children of unfaithfulness.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For their mother has played the prostitute.
VERSE:She who conceived them has done shamefully;
VERSE:for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,
VERSE:who give me my bread and my water,
VERSE:my wool and my flax,
VERSE:my oil and my drink.’
LABEL:6
VERSE:Therefore behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns,
VERSE:and I will build a wall against her,
VERSE:that she can’t find her way.
LABEL:7
VERSE:She will follow after her lovers,
VERSE:but she won’t overtake them;
VERSE:and she will seek them,
VERSE:but won’t find them.
VERSE:Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband,
VERSE:for then it was better with me than now.’
LABEL:8
VERSE:For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,
VERSE:and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,
VERSE:and my new wine in its season,
VERSE:and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
VERSE:and no one will deliver her out of my hand.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:
VERSE:her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
VERSE:about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me,’
VERSE:and I will make them a forest,
VERSE:and the animals of the field shall eat them.
LABEL:13
VERSE:I will visit on her the days of the Baals,
VERSE:to which she burned incense
VERSE:when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,
VERSE:and went after her lovers
VERSE:and forgot me,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:14
VERSE:“Therefore behold, I will allure her,
VERSE:and bring her into the wilderness,
VERSE:and speak tenderly to her.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I will give her vineyards from there,
VERSE:and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;
VERSE:and she will respond there
VERSE:as in the days of her youth,
VERSE:and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It will be in that day,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“that you will call me ‘my husband,’
VERSE:and no longer call me ‘my master.’
LABEL:17
VERSE:For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,
VERSE:and they will no longer be mentioned by name.
LABEL:18
VERSE:In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,
VERSE:and with the birds of the sky,
VERSE:and with the creeping things of the ground.
VERSE:I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,
VERSE:and will make them lie down safely.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I will betroth you to me forever.
VERSE:Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;
VERSE:and you shall know Yahweh.
LABEL:21
VERSE:It will happen in that day, that I will respond,” says Yahweh.
VERSE:“I will respond to the heavens,
VERSE:and they will respond to the earth;
LABEL:22
VERSE:and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;
VERSE:and they will respond to Jezreel.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I will sow her to me in the earth;
VERSE:and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;
VERSE:and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’
VERSE:and they will say, ‘You are My God!’”
