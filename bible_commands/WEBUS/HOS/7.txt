CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Hosea 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:When I would heal Israel,
VERSE:then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
VERSE:also the wickedness of Samaria;
VERSE:for they commit falsehood,
VERSE:and the thief enters in,
VERSE:and the gang of robbers ravages outside.
LABEL:2
VERSE:They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.
VERSE:Now their own deeds have engulfed them.
VERSE:They are before my face.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They make the king glad with their wickedness,
VERSE:and the princes with their lies.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They are all adulterers.
VERSE:They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,
VERSE:from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.
LABEL:5
VERSE:On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.
VERSE:He joined his hand with mockers.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For they have prepared their heart like an oven,
VERSE:while they lie in wait.
VERSE:Their anger smolders all night.
VERSE:In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They are all hot as an oven,
VERSE:and devour their judges.
VERSE:All their kings have fallen.
VERSE:There is no one among them who calls to me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Ephraim mixes himself among the nations.
VERSE:Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Strangers have devoured his strength,
VERSE:and he doesn’t realize it.
VERSE:Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him,
VERSE:and he doesn’t realize it.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The pride of Israel testifies to his face;
VERSE:yet they haven’t returned to Yahweh their God,
VERSE:nor sought him, for all this.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.
VERSE:They call to Egypt.
VERSE:They go to Assyria.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When they go, I will spread my net on them.
VERSE:I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.
VERSE:I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Woe to them!
VERSE:For they have wandered from me.
VERSE:Destruction to them!
VERSE:For they have trespassed against me.
VERSE:Though I would redeem them,
VERSE:yet they have spoken lies against me.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They haven’t cried to me with their heart,
VERSE:but they howl on their beds.
VERSE:They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.
VERSE:They turn away from me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,
VERSE:yet they plot evil against me.
LABEL:16
VERSE:They return, but not to the Most High.
VERSE:They are like a faulty bow.
VERSE:Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.
VERSE:This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.
