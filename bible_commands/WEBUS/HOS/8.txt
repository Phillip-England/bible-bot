CHAPTER:8
TITLE:Hosea 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Put the trumpet to your lips!
VERSE:Something like an eagle is over Yahweh’s house,
VERSE:because they have broken my covenant
VERSE:and rebelled against my law.
LABEL:2
VERSE:They cry to me, ‘My God, we, Israel, acknowledge you!’
LABEL:3
VERSE:Israel has cast off that which is good.
VERSE:The enemy will pursue him.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They have set up kings, but not by me.
VERSE:They have made princes, and I didn’t approve.
VERSE:Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols,
VERSE:that they may be cut off.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!
VERSE:My anger burns against them!
VERSE:How long will it be until they are capable of purity?
LABEL:6
VERSE:For this is even from Israel!
VERSE:The workman made it, and it is no God;
VERSE:indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For they sow the wind,
VERSE:and they will reap the whirlwind.
VERSE:He has no standing grain.
VERSE:The stalk will yield no head.
VERSE:If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Israel is swallowed up.
VERSE:Now they are among the nations like a worthless thing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For they have gone up to Assyria,
VERSE:like a wild donkey wandering alone.
VERSE:Ephraim has hired lovers for himself.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But although they sold themselves among the nations,
VERSE:I will now gather them;
VERSE:and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,
VERSE:they became for him altars for sinning.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I wrote for him the many things of my law,
VERSE:but they were regarded as a strange thing.
LABEL:13
VERSE:As for the sacrifices of my offerings,
VERSE:they sacrifice meat and eat it,
VERSE:but Yahweh doesn’t accept them.
VERSE:Now he will remember their iniquity,
VERSE:and punish their sins.
VERSE:They will return to Egypt.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;
VERSE:and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;
VERSE:but I will send a fire on his cities,
VERSE:and it will devour its fortresses.”
