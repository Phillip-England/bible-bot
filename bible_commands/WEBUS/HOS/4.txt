BOOK:HOS
CHAPTER:4
TITLE:Hosea 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear Yahweh’s word, you children of Israel,
VERSE:for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:
VERSE:“Indeed there is no truth, nor goodness,
VERSE:nor knowledge of God in the land.
LABEL:2
VERSE:There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;
VERSE:they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Therefore the land will mourn,
VERSE:and everyone who dwells in it will waste away,
VERSE:with all living things in her,
VERSE:even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;
VERSE:yes, the fish of the sea also die.
LABEL:4
VERSE:“Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse;
VERSE:for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.
LABEL:5
VERSE:You will stumble in the day,
VERSE:and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;
VERSE:and I will destroy your mother.
LABEL:6
VERSE:My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
VERSE:Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,
VERSE:that you may be no priest to me.
VERSE:Because you have forgotten your God’s law,
VERSE:I will also forget your children.
LABEL:7
VERSE:As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.
VERSE:I will change their glory into shame.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They feed on the sin of my people,
VERSE:and set their heart on their iniquity.
LABEL:9
VERSE:It will be like people, like priest;
VERSE:and I will punish them for their ways,
VERSE:and will repay them for their deeds.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They will eat, and not have enough.
VERSE:They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;
VERSE:because they have abandoned listening to Yahweh.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.
LABEL:12
VERSE:My people consult with their wooden idol,
VERSE:and answer to a stick of wood.
VERSE:Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,
VERSE:and they have been unfaithful to their God.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,
VERSE:and burn incense on the hills, under oaks, poplars, and terebinths,
VERSE:because its shade is good.
VERSE:Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,
VERSE:and your brides commit adultery.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,
VERSE:nor your brides when they commit adultery;
VERSE:because the men consort with prostitutes,
VERSE:and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;
VERSE:so the people without understanding will come to ruin.
LABEL:15
VERSE:“Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,
VERSE:yet don’t let Judah offend;
VERSE:and don’t come to Gilgal,
VERSE:neither go up to Beth Aven,
VERSE:nor swear, ‘As Yahweh lives.’
LABEL:16
VERSE:For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.
VERSE:Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow?
LABEL:17
VERSE:Ephraim is joined to idols.
VERSE:Leave him alone!
LABEL:18
VERSE:Their drink has become sour.
VERSE:They play the prostitute continually.
VERSE:Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;
VERSE:and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.
