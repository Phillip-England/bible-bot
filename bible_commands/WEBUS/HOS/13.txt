TITLE:Hosea 13
LABEL:1
VERSE:When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling.
VERSE:He exalted himself in Israel,
VERSE:but when he became guilty through Baal, he died.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Now they sin more and more,
VERSE:and have made themselves molten images of their silver,
VERSE:even idols according to their own understanding,
VERSE:all of them the work of the craftsmen.
VERSE:They say of them, ‘They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calves.’
LABEL:3
VERSE:Therefore they will be like the morning mist,
VERSE:like the dew that passes away early,
VERSE:like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor,
VERSE:and like the smoke out of the chimney.
LABEL:4
VERSE:“Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt;
VERSE:and you shall acknowledge no god but me,
VERSE:and besides me there is no savior.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I knew you in the wilderness,
VERSE:in the land of great drought.
LABEL:6
VERSE:According to their pasture, so were they filled;
VERSE:they were filled, and their heart was exalted.
VERSE:Therefore they have forgotten me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Therefore I am like a lion to them.
VERSE:Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs,
VERSE:and will tear the covering of their heart.
VERSE:There I will devour them like a lioness.
VERSE:The wild animal will tear them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me,
VERSE:against your helper.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities?
VERSE:And your judges, of whom you said, ‘Give me a king and princes’?
LABEL:11
VERSE:I have given you a king in my anger,
VERSE:and have taken him away in my wrath.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The guilt of Ephraim is stored up.
VERSE:His sin is stored up.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him.
VERSE:He is an unwise son,
VERSE:for when it is time, he doesn’t come to the opening of the womb.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I will ransom them from the power of Sheol.
VERSE:I will redeem them from death!
VERSE:Death, where are your plagues?
VERSE:Sheol, where is your destruction?
VERSE:“Compassion will be hidden from my eyes.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come,
VERSE:the breath of Yahweh coming up from the wilderness;
VERSE:and his spring will become dry,
VERSE:and his fountain will be dried up.
VERSE:He will plunder the storehouse of treasure.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Samaria will bear her guilt,
VERSE:for she has rebelled against her God.
VERSE:They will fall by the sword.
VERSE:Their infants will be dashed in pieces,
VERSE:and their pregnant women will be ripped open.”
