TITLE:Hosea 14
LABEL:1
VERSE:Israel, return to Yahweh your God;
VERSE:for you have fallen because of your sin.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Take words with you, and return to Yahweh.
VERSE:Tell him, “Forgive all our sins,
VERSE:and accept that which is good;
VERSE:so we offer bulls as we vowed of our lips.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Assyria can’t save us.
VERSE:We won’t ride on horses;
VERSE:neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, ‘Our gods!’
VERSE:for in you the fatherless finds mercy.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:“I will heal their waywardness.
VERSE:I will love them freely;
VERSE:for my anger is turned away from them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I will be like the dew to Israel.
VERSE:He will blossom like the lily,
VERSE:and send down his roots like Lebanon.
LABEL:6
VERSE:His branches will spread,
VERSE:and his beauty will be like the olive tree,
VERSE:and his fragrance like Lebanon.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Men will dwell in his shade.
VERSE:They will revive like the grain,
VERSE:and blossom like the vine.
VERSE:Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols?
VERSE:I answer, and will take care of him.
VERSE:I am like a green cypress tree;
VERSE:from me your fruit is found.”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Who is wise, that he may understand these things?
VERSE:Who is prudent, that he may know them?
VERSE:For the ways of Yahweh are right,
VERSE:and the righteous walk in them,
VERSE:but the rebellious stumble in them.
