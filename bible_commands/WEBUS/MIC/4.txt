CHAPTER:4
TITLE:Micah 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:But in the latter days,
VERSE:it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,
VERSE:and it will be exalted above the hills;
VERSE:and peoples will stream to it.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Many nations will go and say,
VERSE:“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
VERSE:and to the house of the God of Jacob;
VERSE:and he will teach us of his ways,
VERSE:and we will walk in his paths.”
VERSE:For the law will go out of Zion,
VERSE:and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;
LABEL:3
VERSE:and he will judge between many peoples,
VERSE:and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.
VERSE:They will beat their swords into plowshares,
VERSE:and their spears into pruning hooks.
VERSE:Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
VERSE:neither will they learn war any more.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree.
VERSE:No one will make them afraid,
VERSE:for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods,
VERSE:but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.
LABEL:6
VERSE:“In that day,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“I will assemble that which is lame,
VERSE:and I will gather that which is driven away,
VERSE:and that which I have afflicted;
LABEL:7
VERSE:and I will make that which was lame a remnant,
VERSE:and that which was cast far off a strong nation:
VERSE:and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,
VERSE:to you it will come.
VERSE:Yes, the former dominion will come,
VERSE:the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Now why do you cry out aloud?
VERSE:Is there no king in you?
VERSE:Has your counselor perished,
VERSE:that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,
VERSE:like a woman in travail;
VERSE:for now you will go out of the city,
VERSE:and will dwell in the field,
VERSE:and will come even to Babylon.
VERSE:There you will be rescued.
VERSE:There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,
VERSE:“Let her be defiled,
VERSE:and let our eye gloat over Zion.”
LABEL:12
VERSE:But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,
VERSE:neither do they understand his counsel;
VERSE:for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,
VERSE:for I will make your horn iron,
VERSE:and I will make your hoofs bronze.
VERSE:You will beat in pieces many peoples.
VERSE:I will devote their gain to Yahweh,
VERSE:and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
