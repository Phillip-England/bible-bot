BOOK:MIC
CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Micah 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:Misery is mine!
VERSE:Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard.
VERSE:There is no cluster of grapes to eat.
VERSE:My soul desires to eat the early fig.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The godly man has perished out of the earth,
VERSE:and there is no one upright among men.
VERSE:They all lie in wait for blood;
VERSE:every man hunts his brother with a net.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.
VERSE:The ruler and judge ask for a bribe.
VERSE:The powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.
VERSE:Thus they conspire together.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The best of them is like a brier.
VERSE:The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.
VERSE:The day of your watchmen,
VERSE:even your visitation, has come;
VERSE:now is the time of their confusion.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Don’t trust in a neighbor.
VERSE:Don’t put confidence in a friend.
VERSE:With the woman lying in your embrace,
VERSE:be careful of the words of your mouth!
LABEL:6
VERSE:For the son dishonors the father,
VERSE:the daughter rises up against her mother,
VERSE:the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
VERSE:a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.
VERSE:I will wait for the God of my salvation.
VERSE:My God will hear me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.
VERSE:When I fall, I will arise.
VERSE:When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,
VERSE:because I have sinned against him,
VERSE:until he pleads my case and executes judgment for me.
VERSE:He will bring me out to the light.
VERSE:I will see his righteousness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Then my enemy will see it,
VERSE:and shame will cover her who said to me,
VERSE:“Where is Yahweh your God?”
VERSE:My eyes will see her.
VERSE:Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.
LABEL:11
VERSE:A day to build your walls!
VERSE:In that day, he will extend your boundary.
LABEL:12
VERSE:In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
VERSE:and from Egypt even to the River,
VERSE:and from sea to sea,
VERSE:and mountain to mountain.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,
VERSE:for the fruit of their doings.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Shepherd your people with your staff,
VERSE:the flock of your heritage,
VERSE:who dwell by themselves in a forest.
VERSE:Let them feed in the middle of fertile pasture land,
VERSE:in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
LABEL:15
VERSE:“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,
VERSE:I will show them marvelous things.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.
VERSE:They will lay their hand on their mouth.
VERSE:Their ears will be deaf.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They will lick the dust like a serpent.
VERSE:Like crawling things of the earth, they will come trembling out of their dens.
VERSE:They will come with fear to Yahweh our God,
VERSE:and will be afraid because of you.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,
VERSE:and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?
VERSE:He doesn’t retain his anger forever,
VERSE:because he delights in loving kindness.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He will again have compassion on us.
VERSE:He will tread our iniquities under foot.
VERSE:You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
LABEL:20
VERSE:You will give truth to Jacob,
VERSE:and mercy to Abraham,
VERSE:as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
