CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Micah 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:I said,
VERSE:“Please listen, you heads of Jacob,
VERSE:and rulers of the house of Israel:
VERSE:Isn’t it for you to know justice?
LABEL:2
VERSE:You who hate the good,
VERSE:and love the evil;
VERSE:who tear off their skin,
VERSE:and their flesh from off their bones;
LABEL:3
VERSE:who also eat the flesh of my people,
VERSE:and peel their skin from off them,
VERSE:and break their bones,
VERSE:and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,
VERSE:and as meat within the cauldron.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Then they will cry to Yahweh,
VERSE:but he will not answer them.
VERSE:Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time,
VERSE:because they made their deeds evil.”
LABEL:5
VERSE:Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray—for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:
LABEL:6
VERSE:“Therefore night is over you, with no vision,
VERSE:and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;
VERSE:and the sun will go down on the prophets,
VERSE:and the day will be black over them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The seers shall be disappointed,
VERSE:and the diviners confounded.
VERSE:Yes, they shall all cover their lips,
VERSE:for there is no answer from God.”
LABEL:8
VERSE:But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit,
VERSE:and of judgment, and of might,
VERSE:to declare to Jacob his disobedience,
VERSE:and to Israel his sin.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,
VERSE:and rulers of the house of Israel,
VERSE:who abhor justice,
VERSE:and pervert all equity,
LABEL:10
VERSE:who build up Zion with blood,
VERSE:and Jerusalem with iniquity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Her leaders judge for bribes,
VERSE:and her priests teach for a price,
VERSE:and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money;
VERSE:yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,
VERSE:“Isn’t Yahweh among us?
VERSE:No disaster will come on us.”
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,
VERSE:and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,
VERSE:and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.
