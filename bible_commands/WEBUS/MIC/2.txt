CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Micah 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:Woe to those who devise iniquity
VERSE:and work evil on their beds!
VERSE:When the morning is light, they practice it,
VERSE:because it is in the power of their hand.
LABEL:2
VERSE:They covet fields and seize them,
VERSE:and houses, then take them away.
VERSE:They oppress a man and his house,
VERSE:even a man and his heritage.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh says:
VERSE:“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,
VERSE:from which you will not remove your necks,
VERSE:neither will you walk haughtily,
VERSE:for it is an evil time.
LABEL:4
VERSE:In that day they will take up a parable against you,
VERSE:and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,
VERSE:‘We are utterly ruined!
VERSE:My people’s possession is divided up.
VERSE:Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’”
LABEL:5
VERSE:Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly.
LABEL:6
VERSE:“Don’t prophesy!”—they prophesy—
VERSE:“Don’t prophesy about these things.
VERSE:Disgrace won’t overtake us.”
LABEL:7
VERSE:Shall it be said, O house of Jacob,
VERSE:“Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry?
VERSE:Are these his doings?
VERSE:Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”
LABEL:8
VERSE:But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.
VERSE:You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.
LABEL:9
VERSE:You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;
VERSE:from their young children you take away my blessing forever.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Arise, and depart!
VERSE:For this is not your resting place,
VERSE:because of uncleanness that destroys,
VERSE:even with a grievous destruction.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying,
VERSE:“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,”
VERSE:he would be the prophet of this people.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob.
VERSE:I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.
VERSE:I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,
VERSE:as a flock in the middle of their pasture.
VERSE:They will swarm with people.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He who breaks open the way goes up before them.
VERSE:They break through the gate, and go out.
VERSE:Their king passes on before them,
VERSE:with Yahweh at their head.
