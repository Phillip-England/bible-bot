CHAPTER:106
TITLE:Psalms 106
LABEL:1
VERSE:Praise Yahweh!
VERSE:Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
VERSE:for his loving kindness endures forever.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh,
VERSE:or fully declare all his praise?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Blessed are those who keep justice.
VERSE:Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people.
VERSE:Visit me with your salvation,
LABEL:5
VERSE:that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,
VERSE:that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
VERSE:that I may glory with your inheritance.
LABEL:6
VERSE:We have sinned with our fathers.
VERSE:We have committed iniquity.
VERSE:We have done wickedly.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.
VERSE:They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,
VERSE:but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,
VERSE:that he might make his mighty power known.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;
VERSE:so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,
VERSE:and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The waters covered their adversaries.
VERSE:There was not one of them left.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Then they believed his words.
VERSE:They sang his praise.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They soon forgot his works.
VERSE:They didn’t wait for his counsel,
LABEL:14
VERSE:but gave in to craving in the desert,
VERSE:and tested God in the wasteland.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He gave them their request,
VERSE:but sent leanness into their soul.
LABEL:16
VERSE:They envied Moses also in the camp,
VERSE:and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
VERSE:and covered the company of Abiram.
LABEL:18
VERSE:A fire was kindled in their company.
VERSE:The flame burned up the wicked.
LABEL:19
VERSE:They made a calf in Horeb,
VERSE:and worshiped a molten image.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thus they exchanged their glory
VERSE:for an image of a bull that eats grass.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They forgot God, their Savior,
VERSE:who had done great things in Egypt,
LABEL:22
VERSE:wondrous works in the land of Ham,
VERSE:and awesome things by the Red Sea.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
VERSE:had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,
VERSE:to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Yes, they despised the pleasant land.
VERSE:They didn’t believe his word,
LABEL:25
VERSE:but murmured in their tents,
VERSE:and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Therefore he swore to them
VERSE:that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
LABEL:27
VERSE:that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations,
VERSE:and scatter them in the lands.
LABEL:28
VERSE:They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,
VERSE:and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.
VERSE:The plague broke in on them.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment,
VERSE:so the plague was stopped.
LABEL:31
VERSE:That was credited to him for righteousness,
VERSE:for all generations to come.
LABEL:32
VERSE:They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,
VERSE:so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;
LABEL:33
VERSE:because they were rebellious against his spirit,
VERSE:he spoke rashly with his lips.
LABEL:34
VERSE:They didn’t destroy the peoples,
VERSE:as Yahweh commanded them,
LABEL:35
VERSE:but mixed themselves with the nations,
VERSE:and learned their works.
LABEL:36
VERSE:They served their idols,
VERSE:which became a snare to them.
LABEL:37
VERSE:Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
LABEL:38
VERSE:They shed innocent blood,
VERSE:even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
VERSE:whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
VERSE:The land was polluted with blood.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Thus they were defiled with their works,
VERSE:and prostituted themselves in their deeds.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.
VERSE:He abhorred his inheritance.
LABEL:41
VERSE:He gave them into the hand of the nations.
VERSE:Those who hated them ruled over them.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Their enemies also oppressed them.
VERSE:They were brought into subjection under their hand.
LABEL:43
VERSE:He rescued them many times,
VERSE:but they were rebellious in their counsel,
VERSE:and were brought low in their iniquity.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Nevertheless he regarded their distress,
VERSE:when he heard their cry.
LABEL:45
VERSE:He remembered for them his covenant,
VERSE:and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
LABEL:46
VERSE:He made them also to be pitied
VERSE:by all those who carried them captive.
LABEL:47
VERSE:Save us, Yahweh, our God,
VERSE:gather us from among the nations,
VERSE:to give thanks to your holy name,
VERSE:to triumph in your praise!
LABEL:48
VERSE:Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
VERSE:from everlasting even to everlasting!
VERSE:Let all the people say, “Amen.”
VERSE:Praise Yah!
