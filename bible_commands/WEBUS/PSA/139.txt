CHAPTER:139
TITLE:Psalms 139
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh, you have searched me,
VERSE:and you know me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:You know my sitting down and my rising up.
VERSE:You perceive my thoughts from afar.
LABEL:3
VERSE:You search out my path and my lying down,
VERSE:and are acquainted with all my ways.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For there is not a word on my tongue,
VERSE:but behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.
LABEL:5
VERSE:You hem me in behind and before.
VERSE:You laid your hand on me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:This knowledge is beyond me.
VERSE:It’s lofty.
VERSE:I can’t attain it.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Where could I go from your Spirit?
VERSE:Or where could I flee from your presence?
LABEL:8
VERSE:If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.
VERSE:If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!
LABEL:9
VERSE:If I take the wings of the dawn,
VERSE:and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea,
LABEL:10
VERSE:even there your hand will lead me,
VERSE:and your right hand will hold me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me.
VERSE:The light around me will be night,”
LABEL:12
VERSE:even the darkness doesn’t hide from you,
VERSE:but the night shines as the day.
VERSE:The darkness is like light to you.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For you formed my inmost being.
VERSE:You knit me together in my mother’s womb.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I will give thanks to you,
VERSE:for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
VERSE:Your works are wonderful.
VERSE:My soul knows that very well.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My frame wasn’t hidden from you,
VERSE:when I was made in secret,
VERSE:woven together in the depths of the earth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Your eyes saw my body.
VERSE:In your book they were all written,
VERSE:the days that were ordained for me,
VERSE:when as yet there were none of them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:How precious to me are your thoughts, God!
VERSE:How vast is their sum!
LABEL:18
VERSE:If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.
VERSE:When I wake up, I am still with you.
LABEL:19
VERSE:If only you, God, would kill the wicked.
VERSE:Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!
LABEL:20
VERSE:For they speak against you wickedly.
VERSE:Your enemies take your name in vain.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Yahweh, don’t I hate those who hate you?
VERSE:Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?
LABEL:22
VERSE:I hate them with perfect hatred.
VERSE:They have become my enemies.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Search me, God, and know my heart.
VERSE:Try me, and know my thoughts.
LABEL:24
VERSE:See if there is any wicked way in me,
VERSE:and lead me in the everlasting way.
