CHAPTER:18
TITLE:Psalms 18
LABEL:1
VERSE:I love you, Yahweh, my strength.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;
VERSE:my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;
VERSE:my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;
VERSE:and I am saved from my enemies.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The cords of death surrounded me.
VERSE:The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The cords of Sheol were around me.
VERSE:The snares of death came on me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In my distress I called on Yahweh,
VERSE:and cried to my God.
VERSE:He heard my voice out of his temple.
VERSE:My cry before him came into his ears.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Then the earth shook and trembled.
VERSE:The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,
VERSE:because he was angry.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Smoke went out of his nostrils.
VERSE:Consuming fire came out of his mouth.
VERSE:Coals were kindled by it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
VERSE:Thick darkness was under his feet.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He rode on a cherub, and flew.
VERSE:Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,
VERSE:darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
LABEL:12
VERSE:At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
VERSE:hailstones and coals of fire.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yahweh also thundered in the sky.
VERSE:The Most High uttered his voice:
VERSE:hailstones and coals of fire.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He sent out his arrows, and scattered them.
VERSE:He routed them with great lightning bolts.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then the channels of waters appeared.
VERSE:The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh,
VERSE:at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He sent from on high.
VERSE:He took me.
VERSE:He drew me out of many waters.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He delivered me from my strong enemy,
VERSE:from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They came on me in the day of my calamity,
VERSE:but Yahweh was my support.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He brought me out also into a large place.
VERSE:He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness.
VERSE:According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For I have kept the ways of Yahweh,
VERSE:and have not wickedly departed from my God.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For all his ordinances were before me.
VERSE:I didn’t put away his statutes from me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I was also blameless with him.
VERSE:I kept myself from my iniquity.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
VERSE:according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
LABEL:25
VERSE:With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
VERSE:With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
LABEL:26
VERSE:With the pure, you will show yourself pure.
VERSE:With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For you will save the afflicted people,
VERSE:but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For you will light my lamp, Yahweh.
VERSE:My God will light up my darkness.
LABEL:29
VERSE:For by you, I advance through a troop.
VERSE:By my God, I leap over a wall.
LABEL:30
VERSE:As for God, his way is perfect.
VERSE:Yahweh’s word is tried.
VERSE:He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For who is God, except Yahweh?
VERSE:Who is a rock, besides our God,
LABEL:32
VERSE:the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
LABEL:33
VERSE:He makes my feet like deer’s feet,
VERSE:and sets me on my high places.
LABEL:34
VERSE:He teaches my hands to war,
VERSE:so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
LABEL:35
VERSE:You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
VERSE:Your right hand sustains me.
VERSE:Your gentleness has made me great.
LABEL:36
VERSE:You have enlarged my steps under me,
VERSE:My feet have not slipped.
LABEL:37
VERSE:I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.
VERSE:I won’t turn away until they are consumed.
LABEL:38
VERSE:I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.
VERSE:They shall fall under my feet.
LABEL:39
VERSE:For you have armed me with strength to the battle.
VERSE:You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
LABEL:40
VERSE:You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
VERSE:that I might cut off those who hate me.
LABEL:41
VERSE:They cried, but there was no one to save;
VERSE:even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.
VERSE:I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
LABEL:43
VERSE:You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.
VERSE:You have made me the head of the nations.
VERSE:A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
LABEL:44
VERSE:As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.
VERSE:The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
LABEL:45
VERSE:The foreigners shall fade away,
VERSE:and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.
LABEL:46
VERSE:Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock.
VERSE:Exalted be the God of my salvation,
LABEL:47
VERSE:even the God who executes vengeance for me,
VERSE:and subdues peoples under me.
LABEL:48
VERSE:He rescues me from my enemies.
VERSE:Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.
VERSE:You deliver me from the violent man.
LABEL:49
VERSE:Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,
VERSE:and will sing praises to your name.
LABEL:50
VERSE:He gives great deliverance to his king,
VERSE:and shows loving kindness to his anointed,
VERSE:to David and to his offspring, forever more.
