CHAPTER:109
TITLE:Psalms 109
LABEL:1
VERSE:God of my praise, don’t remain silent,
LABEL:2
VERSE:for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me.
VERSE:They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,
VERSE:and fought against me without a cause.
LABEL:4
VERSE:In return for my love, they are my adversaries;
VERSE:but I am in prayer.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They have rewarded me evil for good,
VERSE:and hatred for my love.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Set a wicked man over him.
VERSE:Let an adversary stand at his right hand.
LABEL:7
VERSE:When he is judged, let him come out guilty.
VERSE:Let his prayer be turned into sin.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let his days be few.
VERSE:Let another take his office.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let his children be fatherless,
VERSE:and his wife a widow.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Let his children be wandering beggars.
VERSE:Let them be sought from their ruins.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Let the creditor seize all that he has.
VERSE:Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let there be no one to extend kindness to him,
VERSE:neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Let his posterity be cut off.
VERSE:In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.
VERSE:Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let them be before Yahweh continually,
VERSE:that he may cut off their memory from the earth;
LABEL:16
VERSE:because he didn’t remember to show kindness,
VERSE:but persecuted the poor and needy man,
VERSE:the broken in heart, to kill them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.
VERSE:He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.
VERSE:It came into his inward parts like water,
VERSE:like oil into his bones.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,
VERSE:for the belt that is always around him.
LABEL:20
VERSE:This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh,
VERSE:of those who speak evil against my soul.
LABEL:21
VERSE:But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord, for your name’s sake,
VERSE:because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;
LABEL:22
VERSE:for I am poor and needy.
VERSE:My heart is wounded within me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I fade away like an evening shadow.
VERSE:I am shaken off like a locust.
LABEL:24
VERSE:My knees are weak through fasting.
VERSE:My body is thin and lacks fat.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I have also become a reproach to them.
VERSE:When they see me, they shake their head.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Help me, Yahweh, my God.
VERSE:Save me according to your loving kindness;
LABEL:27
VERSE:that they may know that this is your hand;
VERSE:that you, Yahweh, have done it.
LABEL:28
VERSE:They may curse, but you bless.
VERSE:When they arise, they will be shamed,
VERSE:but your servant shall rejoice.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.
VERSE:Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.
VERSE:Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,
VERSE:to save him from those who judge his soul.
