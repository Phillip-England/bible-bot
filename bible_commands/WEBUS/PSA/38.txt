TITLE:Psalms 38
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath,
VERSE:neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For your arrows have pierced me,
VERSE:your hand presses hard on me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,
VERSE:neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For my iniquities have gone over my head.
VERSE:As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:My wounds are loathsome and corrupt
VERSE:because of my foolishness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I am in pain and bowed down greatly.
VERSE:I go mourning all day long.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For my waist is filled with burning.
VERSE:There is no soundness in my flesh.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I am faint and severely bruised.
VERSE:I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Lord, all my desire is before you.
VERSE:My groaning is not hidden from you.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My heart throbs.
VERSE:My strength fails me.
VERSE:As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.
VERSE:My kinsmen stand far away.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They also who seek after my life lay snares.
VERSE:Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
VERSE:and meditate deceits all day long.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear.
VERSE:I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear,
VERSE:in whose mouth are no reproofs.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For I hope in you, Yahweh.
VERSE:You will answer, Lord my God.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me,
VERSE:or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”
LABEL:17
VERSE:For I am ready to fall.
VERSE:My pain is continually before me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For I will declare my iniquity.
VERSE:I will be sorry for my sin.
LABEL:19
VERSE:But my enemies are vigorous and many.
VERSE:Those who hate me without reason are numerous.
LABEL:20
VERSE:They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me,
VERSE:because I follow what is good.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Don’t forsake me, Yahweh.
VERSE:My God, don’t be far from me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Hurry to help me,
VERSE:Lord, my salvation.
