CHAPTER:44
TITLE:Psalms 44
LABEL:1
VERSE:We have heard with our ears, God;
VERSE:our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,
VERSE:in the days of old.
LABEL:2
VERSE:You drove out the nations with your hand,
VERSE:but you planted them.
VERSE:You afflicted the peoples,
VERSE:but you spread them abroad.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword,
VERSE:neither did their own arm save them;
VERSE:but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,
VERSE:because you were favorable to them.
LABEL:4
VERSE:God, you are my King.
VERSE:Command victories for Jacob!
LABEL:5
VERSE:Through you, we will push down our adversaries.
VERSE:Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For I will not trust in my bow,
VERSE:neither will my sword save me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But you have saved us from our adversaries,
VERSE:and have shamed those who hate us.
LABEL:8
VERSE:In God we have made our boast all day long.
VERSE:We will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.
LABEL:9
VERSE:But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor,
VERSE:and don’t go out with our armies.
LABEL:10
VERSE:You make us turn back from the adversary.
VERSE:Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.
LABEL:11
VERSE:You have made us like sheep for food,
VERSE:and have scattered us among the nations.
LABEL:12
VERSE:You sell your people for nothing,
VERSE:and have gained nothing from their sale.
LABEL:13
VERSE:You make us a reproach to our neighbors,
VERSE:a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.
LABEL:14
VERSE:You make us a byword among the nations,
VERSE:a shaking of the head among the peoples.
LABEL:15
VERSE:All day long my dishonor is before me,
VERSE:and shame covers my face,
LABEL:16
VERSE:at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,
VERSE:because of the enemy and the avenger.
LABEL:17
VERSE:All this has come on us,
VERSE:yet we haven’t forgotten you.
VERSE:We haven’t been false to your covenant.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Our heart has not turned back,
VERSE:neither have our steps strayed from your path,
LABEL:19
VERSE:though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,
VERSE:and covered us with the shadow of death.
LABEL:20
VERSE:If we have forgotten the name of our God,
VERSE:or spread out our hands to a strange god,
LABEL:21
VERSE:won’t God search this out?
VERSE:For he knows the secrets of the heart.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.
VERSE:We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Wake up!
VERSE:Why do you sleep, Lord?
VERSE:Arise!
VERSE:Don’t reject us forever.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Why do you hide your face,
VERSE:and forget our affliction and our oppression?
LABEL:25
VERSE:For our soul is bowed down to the dust.
VERSE:Our body clings to the earth.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Rise up to help us.
VERSE:Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.
