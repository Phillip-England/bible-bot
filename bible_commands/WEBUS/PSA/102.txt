TITLE:Psalms 102
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear my prayer, Yahweh!
VERSE:Let my cry come to you.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Don’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress.
VERSE:Turn your ear to me.
VERSE:Answer me quickly in the day when I call.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For my days consume away like smoke.
VERSE:My bones are burned as a torch.
LABEL:4
VERSE:My heart is blighted like grass, and withered,
VERSE:for I forget to eat my bread.
LABEL:5
VERSE:By reason of the voice of my groaning,
VERSE:my bones stick to my skin.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I am like a pelican of the wilderness.
VERSE:I have become as an owl of the waste places.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.
LABEL:8
VERSE:My enemies reproach me all day.
VERSE:Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For I have eaten ashes like bread,
VERSE:and mixed my drink with tears,
LABEL:10
VERSE:because of your indignation and your wrath;
VERSE:for you have taken me up and thrown me away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My days are like a long shadow.
VERSE:I have withered like grass.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But you, Yahweh, will remain forever;
VERSE:your renown endures to all generations.
LABEL:13
VERSE:You will arise and have mercy on Zion,
VERSE:for it is time to have pity on her.
VERSE:Yes, the set time has come.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For your servants take pleasure in her stones,
VERSE:and have pity on her dust.
LABEL:15
VERSE:So the nations will fear Yahweh’s name,
VERSE:all the kings of the earth your glory.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For Yahweh has built up Zion.
VERSE:He has appeared in his glory.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He has responded to the prayer of the destitute,
VERSE:and has not despised their prayer.
LABEL:18
VERSE:This will be written for the generation to come.
VERSE:A people which will be created will praise Yah,
LABEL:19
VERSE:for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.
VERSE:From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth,
LABEL:20
VERSE:to hear the groans of the prisoner,
VERSE:to free those who are condemned to death,
LABEL:21
VERSE:that men may declare Yahweh’s name in Zion,
VERSE:and his praise in Jerusalem,
LABEL:22
VERSE:when the peoples are gathered together,
VERSE:the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He weakened my strength along the course.
VERSE:He shortened my days.
LABEL:24
VERSE:I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the middle of my days.
VERSE:Your years are throughout all generations.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.
VERSE:The heavens are the work of your hands.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They will perish, but you will endure.
VERSE:Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.
VERSE:You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.
LABEL:27
VERSE:But you are the same.
VERSE:Your years will have no end.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The children of your servants will continue.
VERSE:Their offspring will be established before you.”
