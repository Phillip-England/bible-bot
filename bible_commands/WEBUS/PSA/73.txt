SECTION:BOOK 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:Surely God is good to Israel,
VERSE:to those who are pure in heart.
LABEL:2
VERSE:But as for me, my feet were almost gone.
VERSE:My steps had nearly slipped.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I was envious of the arrogant,
VERSE:when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For there are no struggles in their death,
VERSE:but their strength is firm.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They are free from burdens of men,
VERSE:neither are they plagued like other men.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.
VERSE:Violence covers them like a garment.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Their eyes bulge with fat.
VERSE:Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They scoff and speak with malice.
VERSE:In arrogance, they threaten oppression.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They have set their mouth in the heavens.
VERSE:Their tongue walks through the earth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore their people return to them,
VERSE:and they drink up waters of abundance.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They say, “How does God know?
VERSE:Is there knowledge in the Most High?”
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, these are the wicked.
VERSE:Being always at ease, they increase in riches.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,
VERSE:and washed my hands in innocence,
LABEL:14
VERSE:For all day long I have been plagued,
VERSE:and punished every morning.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If I had said, “I will speak thus”,
VERSE:behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
LABEL:16
VERSE:When I tried to understand this,
VERSE:it was too painful for me—
LABEL:17
VERSE:until I entered God’s sanctuary,
VERSE:and considered their latter end.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Surely you set them in slippery places.
VERSE:You throw them down to destruction.
LABEL:19
VERSE:How they are suddenly destroyed!
VERSE:They are completely swept away with terrors.
LABEL:20
VERSE:As a dream when one wakes up,
VERSE:so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For my soul was grieved.
VERSE:I was embittered in my heart.
LABEL:22
VERSE:I was so senseless and ignorant.
VERSE:I was a brute beast before you.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Nevertheless, I am continually with you.
VERSE:You have held my right hand.
LABEL:24
VERSE:You will guide me with your counsel,
VERSE:and afterward receive me to glory.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Whom do I have in heaven?
VERSE:There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.
LABEL:26
VERSE:My flesh and my heart fails,
VERSE:but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.
VERSE:You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
LABEL:28
VERSE:But it is good for me to come close to God.
VERSE:I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge,
VERSE:that I may tell of all your works.
