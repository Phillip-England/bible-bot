VERSE:He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.
VERSE:Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.

VERSE:Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust,
VERSE:and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,
VERSE:and your thoughts which are toward us.
VERSE:They can’t be declared back to you.
VERSE:If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.

VERSE:Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.
VERSE:You have opened my ears.

VERSE:For innumerable evils have surrounded me.
VERSE:My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.

LABEL:13
VERSE:Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.

VERSE:You are my help and my deliverer.
VERSE:Don’t delay, my God.
