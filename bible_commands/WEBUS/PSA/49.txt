CHAPTER:49
TITLE:Psalms 49
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear this, all you peoples.
VERSE:Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,
LABEL:2
VERSE:both low and high,
VERSE:rich and poor together.
LABEL:3
VERSE:My mouth will speak words of wisdom.
VERSE:My heart will utter understanding.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will incline my ear to a proverb.
VERSE:I will solve my riddle on the harp.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Why should I fear in the days of evil,
VERSE:when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Those who trust in their wealth,
VERSE:and boast in the multitude of their riches—
LABEL:7
VERSE:none of them can by any means redeem his brother,
VERSE:nor give God a ransom for him.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For the redemption of their life is costly,
VERSE:no payment is ever enough,
LABEL:9
VERSE:that he should live on forever,
VERSE:that he should not see corruption.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For he sees that wise men die;
VERSE:likewise the fool and the senseless perish,
VERSE:and leave their wealth to others.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,
VERSE:and their dwelling places to all generations.
VERSE:They name their lands after themselves.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure.
VERSE:He is like the animals that perish.
LABEL:13
VERSE:This is the destiny of those who are foolish,
VERSE:and of those who approve their sayings. Selah.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.
VERSE:Death shall be their shepherd.
VERSE:The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.
VERSE:Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,
VERSE:far from their mansion.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,
VERSE:for he will receive me. Selah.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich,
VERSE:when the glory of his house is increased;
LABEL:17
VERSE:for when he dies he will carry nothing away.
VERSE:His glory won’t descend after him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Though while he lived he blessed his soul—
VERSE:and men praise you when you do well for yourself—
LABEL:19
VERSE:he shall go to the generation of his fathers.
VERSE:They shall never see the light.
LABEL:20
VERSE:A man who has riches without understanding,
VERSE:is like the animals that perish.
