LABEL:1
VERSE:Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
VERSE:for his loving kindness endures forever.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so,
VERSE:whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
LABEL:3
VERSE:and gathered out of the lands,
VERSE:from the east and from the west,
VERSE:from the north and from the south.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.
VERSE:They found no city to live in.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Hungry and thirsty,
VERSE:their soul fainted in them.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,
VERSE:and he delivered them out of their distresses.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He led them also by a straight way,
VERSE:that they might go to a city to live in.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
VERSE:for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
LABEL:9
VERSE:For he satisfies the longing soul.
VERSE:He fills the hungry soul with good.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
VERSE:being bound in affliction and iron,
LABEL:11
VERSE:because they rebelled against the words of God,
VERSE:and condemned the counsel of the Most High.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.
VERSE:They fell down, and there was no one to help.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,
VERSE:and he saved them out of their distresses.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
VERSE:and broke away their chains.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
VERSE:for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
LABEL:16
VERSE:For he has broken the gates of bronze,
VERSE:and cut through bars of iron.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,
VERSE:and because of their iniquities.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Their soul abhors all kinds of food.
VERSE:They draw near to the gates of death.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,
VERSE:and he saves them out of their distresses.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He sends his word, and heals them,
VERSE:and delivers them from their graves.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
VERSE:for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
LABEL:22
VERSE:Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
VERSE:and declare his deeds with singing.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Those who go down to the sea in ships,
VERSE:who do business in great waters,
LABEL:24
VERSE:these see Yahweh’s deeds,
VERSE:and his wonders in the deep.
LABEL:25
VERSE:For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,
VERSE:which lifts up its waves.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.
VERSE:Their soul melts away because of trouble.
LABEL:27
VERSE:They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,
VERSE:and are at their wits’ end.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,
VERSE:and he brings them out of their distress.
LABEL:29
VERSE:He makes the storm a calm,
VERSE:so that its waves are still.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Then they are glad because it is calm,
VERSE:so he brings them to their desired haven.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
VERSE:for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!
LABEL:32
VERSE:Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
VERSE:and praise him in the seat of the elders.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He turns rivers into a desert,
VERSE:water springs into a thirsty ground,
LABEL:34
VERSE:and a fruitful land into a salt waste,
VERSE:for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
LABEL:35
VERSE:He turns a desert into a pool of water,
VERSE:and a dry land into water springs.
LABEL:36
VERSE:There he makes the hungry live,
VERSE:that they may prepare a city to live in,
LABEL:37
VERSE:sow fields, plant vineyards,
VERSE:and reap the fruits of increase.
LABEL:38
VERSE:He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.
VERSE:He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Again, they are diminished and bowed down
VERSE:through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
LABEL:40
VERSE:He pours contempt on princes,
VERSE:and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,
VERSE:and increases their families like a flock.
LABEL:42
VERSE:The upright will see it, and be glad.
VERSE:All the wicked will shut their mouths.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.
VERSE:They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.
