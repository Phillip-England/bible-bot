TITLE:Psalms 77
LABEL:1
VERSE:My cry goes to God!
VERSE:Indeed, I cry to God for help,
VERSE:and for him to listen to me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.
VERSE:My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.
VERSE:My soul refused to be comforted.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I remember God, and I groan.
VERSE:I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.
LABEL:4
VERSE:You hold my eyelids open.
VERSE:I am so troubled that I can’t speak.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I have considered the days of old,
VERSE:the years of ancient times.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I remember my song in the night.
VERSE:I consider in my own heart;
VERSE:my spirit diligently inquires:
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Will the Lord reject us forever?
VERSE:Will he be favorable no more?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Has his loving kindness vanished forever?
VERSE:Does his promise fail for generations?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Has God forgotten to be gracious?
VERSE:Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” Selah.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:
VERSE:the years of the right hand of the Most High.”
LABEL:11
VERSE:I will remember Yah’s deeds;
VERSE:for I will remember your wonders of old.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will also meditate on all your work,
VERSE:and consider your doings.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.
VERSE:What god is great like God?
LABEL:14
VERSE:You are the God who does wonders.
VERSE:You have made your strength known among the peoples.
LABEL:15
VERSE:You have redeemed your people with your arm,
VERSE:the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The waters saw you, God.
VERSE:The waters saw you, and they writhed.
VERSE:The depths also convulsed.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The clouds poured out water.
VERSE:The skies resounded with thunder.
VERSE:Your arrows also flashed around.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.
VERSE:The lightnings lit up the world.
VERSE:The earth trembled and shook.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Your way was through the sea,
VERSE:your paths through the great waters.
VERSE:Your footsteps were not known.
LABEL:20
VERSE:You led your people like a flock,
VERSE:by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
