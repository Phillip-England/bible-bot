VERSE:Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor.

LABEL:5
VERSE:Let them be as chaff before the wind,
VERSE:Yahweh’s angel driving them on.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Let their way be dark and slippery,
VERSE:Yahweh’s angel pursuing them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.
VERSE:Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.

VERSE:All my bones shall say, “Yahweh, who is like you,
VERSE:who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him;
VERSE:yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”
LABEL:11
VERSE:Unrighteous witnesses rise up.
VERSE:They ask me about things that I don’t know about.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They reward me evil for good,
VERSE:to the bereaving of my soul.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.
VERSE:I afflicted my soul with fasting.
VERSE:My prayer returned into my own bosom.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.
VERSE:I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.

VERSE:Like the profane mockers in feasts,
VERSE:they gnashed their teeth at me.

LABEL:18
VERSE:I will give you thanks in the great assembly.
VERSE:I will praise you among many people.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;
VERSE:neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.
LABEL:20
VERSE:For they don’t speak peace,
VERSE:but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.

VERSE:who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!”
LABEL:28
VERSE:My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.
