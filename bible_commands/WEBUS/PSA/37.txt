CHAPTER:37
TITLE:Psalms 37
LABEL:1
VERSE:Don’t fret because of evildoers,
VERSE:neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,
VERSE:and wither like the green herb.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Trust in Yahweh, and do good.
VERSE:Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Also delight yourself in Yahweh,
VERSE:and he will give you the desires of your heart.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Commit your way to Yahweh.
VERSE:Trust also in him, and he will do this:
LABEL:6
VERSE:he will make your righteousness shine out like light,
VERSE:and your justice as the noon day sun.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him.
VERSE:Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way,
VERSE:because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.
VERSE:Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For evildoers shall be cut off,
VERSE:but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.
VERSE:Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But the humble shall inherit the land,
VERSE:and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The wicked plots against the just,
VERSE:and gnashes at him with his teeth.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The Lord will laugh at him,
VERSE:for he sees that his day is coming.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
VERSE:to cast down the poor and needy,
VERSE:to kill those who are upright on the path.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Their sword shall enter into their own heart.
VERSE:Their bows shall be broken.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Better is a little that the righteous has,
VERSE:than the abundance of many wicked.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
VERSE:but Yahweh upholds the righteous.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.
VERSE:Their inheritance shall be forever.
LABEL:19
VERSE:They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.
VERSE:In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
LABEL:20
VERSE:But the wicked shall perish.
VERSE:The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields.
VERSE:They will vanish—
VERSE:vanish like smoke.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,
VERSE:but the righteous give generously.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.
VERSE:Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.
LABEL:23
VERSE:A man’s steps are established by Yahweh.
VERSE:He delights in his way.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Though he stumble, he shall not fall,
VERSE:for Yahweh holds him up with his hand.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I have been young, and now am old,
VERSE:yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,
VERSE:nor his children begging for bread.
LABEL:26
VERSE:All day long he deals graciously, and lends.
VERSE:His offspring is blessed.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Depart from evil, and do good.
VERSE:Live securely forever.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For Yahweh loves justice,
VERSE:and doesn’t forsake his saints.
VERSE:They are preserved forever,
VERSE:but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
LABEL:29
VERSE:The righteous shall inherit the land,
VERSE:and live in it forever.
LABEL:30
VERSE:The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.
VERSE:His tongue speaks justice.
LABEL:31
VERSE:The law of his God is in his heart.
VERSE:None of his steps shall slide.
LABEL:32
VERSE:The wicked watch the righteous,
VERSE:and seek to kill him.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Yahweh will not leave him in his hand,
VERSE:nor condemn him when he is judged.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way,
VERSE:and he will exalt you to inherit the land.
VERSE:When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
LABEL:35
VERSE:I have seen the wicked in great power,
VERSE:spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.
LABEL:36
VERSE:But he passed away, and behold, he was not.
VERSE:Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.
LABEL:37
VERSE:Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,
VERSE:for there is a future for the man of peace.
LABEL:38
VERSE:As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.
VERSE:The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
LABEL:39
VERSE:But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.
VERSE:He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Yahweh helps them and rescues them.
VERSE:He rescues them from the wicked and saves them,
VERSE:because they have taken refuge in him.
