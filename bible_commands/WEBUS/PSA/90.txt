VERSE:Lord, you have been our dwelling place for all generations.

VERSE:Before the mountains were born,
VERSE:before you had formed the earth and the world,
VERSE:even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
LABEL:3
VERSE:You turn man to destruction, saying,
VERSE:“Return, you children of men.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past,
VERSE:like a watch in the night.
LABEL:5
VERSE:You sweep them away as they sleep.
VERSE:In the morning they sprout like new grass.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In the morning it sprouts and springs up.
VERSE:By evening, it is withered and dry.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For we are consumed in your anger.
VERSE:We are troubled in your wrath.
LABEL:8
VERSE:You have set our iniquities before you,
VERSE:our secret sins in the light of your presence.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For all our days have passed away in your wrath.
VERSE:We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The days of our years are seventy,
VERSE:or even by reason of strength eighty years;
VERSE:yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,
VERSE:for it passes quickly, and we fly away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Who knows the power of your anger,
VERSE:your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?
LABEL:12
VERSE:So teach us to count our days,
VERSE:that we may gain a heart of wisdom.

VERSE:How long?
VERSE:Have compassion on your servants!
LABEL:14
VERSE:Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness,
VERSE:that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
VERSE:for as many years as we have seen evil.

VERSE:Let your work appear to your servants,
VERSE:your glory to their children.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us.
VERSE:Establish the work of our hands for us.
