VERSE:You brought a vine out of Egypt.
VERSE:You drove out the nations, and planted it.

VERSE:You cleared the ground for it.
VERSE:It took deep root, and filled the land.

VERSE:The mountains were covered with its shadow.
VERSE:Its boughs were like God’s cedars.
LABEL:11
VERSE:It sent out its branches to the sea,
VERSE:its shoots to the River.

VERSE:Why have you broken down its walls,
VERSE:so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?

VERSE:the stock which your right hand planted,
VERSE:the branch that you made strong for yourself.
