CHAPTER:78
TITLE:Psalms 78
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear my teaching, my people.
VERSE:Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I will open my mouth in a parable.
VERSE:I will utter dark sayings of old,
LABEL:3
VERSE:which we have heard and known,
VERSE:and our fathers have told us.
LABEL:4
VERSE:We will not hide them from their children,
VERSE:telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,
VERSE:his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For he established a covenant in Jacob,
VERSE:and appointed a teaching in Israel,
VERSE:which he commanded our fathers,
VERSE:that they should make them known to their children;
LABEL:6
VERSE:that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;
VERSE:who should arise and tell their children,
LABEL:7
VERSE:that they might set their hope in God,
VERSE:and not forget God’s deeds,
VERSE:but keep his commandments,
LABEL:8
VERSE:and might not be as their fathers—
VERSE:a stubborn and rebellious generation,
VERSE:a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,
VERSE:whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
VERSE:turned back in the day of battle.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They didn’t keep God’s covenant,
VERSE:and refused to walk in his law.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They forgot his doings,
VERSE:his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,
VERSE:in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.
VERSE:He made the waters stand as a heap.
LABEL:14
VERSE:In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,
VERSE:and all night with a light of fire.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He split rocks in the wilderness,
VERSE:and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He brought streams also out of the rock,
VERSE:and caused waters to run down like rivers.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Yet they still went on to sin against him,
VERSE:to rebel against the Most High in the desert.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They tempted God in their heart
VERSE:by asking food according to their desire.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Yes, they spoke against God.
VERSE:They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,
VERSE:and streams overflowed.
VERSE:Can he give bread also?
VERSE:Will he provide meat for his people?”
LABEL:21
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.
VERSE:A fire was kindled against Jacob,
VERSE:anger also went up against Israel,
LABEL:22
VERSE:because they didn’t believe in God,
VERSE:and didn’t trust in his salvation.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Yet he commanded the skies above,
VERSE:and opened the doors of heaven.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He rained down manna on them to eat,
VERSE:and gave them food from the sky.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Man ate the bread of angels.
VERSE:He sent them food to the full.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.
VERSE:By his power he guided the south wind.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He also rained meat on them as the dust,
VERSE:winged birds as the sand of the seas.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He let them fall in the middle of their camp,
VERSE:around their habitations.
LABEL:29
VERSE:So they ate, and were well filled.
VERSE:He gave them their own desire.
LABEL:30
VERSE:They didn’t turn from their cravings.
VERSE:Their food was yet in their mouths,
LABEL:31
VERSE:when the anger of God went up against them,
VERSE:killed some of their strongest,
VERSE:and struck down the young men of Israel.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For all this they still sinned,
VERSE:and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,
VERSE:and their years in terror.
LABEL:34
VERSE:When he killed them, then they inquired after him.
VERSE:They returned and sought God earnestly.
LABEL:35
VERSE:They remembered that God was their rock,
VERSE:the Most High God, their redeemer.
LABEL:36
VERSE:But they flattered him with their mouth,
VERSE:and lied to him with their tongue.
LABEL:37
VERSE:For their heart was not right with him,
VERSE:neither were they faithful in his covenant.
LABEL:38
VERSE:But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.
VERSE:Yes, many times he turned his anger away,
VERSE:and didn’t stir up all his wrath.
LABEL:39
VERSE:He remembered that they were but flesh,
VERSE:a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.
LABEL:40
VERSE:How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
VERSE:and grieved him in the desert!
LABEL:41
VERSE:They turned again and tempted God,
VERSE:and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:42
VERSE:They didn’t remember his hand,
VERSE:nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
LABEL:43
VERSE:how he set his signs in Egypt,
VERSE:his wonders in the field of Zoan,
LABEL:44
VERSE:he turned their rivers into blood,
VERSE:and their streams, so that they could not drink.
LABEL:45
VERSE:He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
VERSE:and frogs, which destroyed them.
LABEL:46
VERSE:He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,
VERSE:and their labor to the locust.
LABEL:47
VERSE:He destroyed their vines with hail,
VERSE:their sycamore fig trees with frost.
LABEL:48
VERSE:He also gave over their livestock to the hail,
VERSE:and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
LABEL:49
VERSE:He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,
VERSE:wrath, indignation, and trouble,
VERSE:and a band of angels of evil.
LABEL:50
VERSE:He made a path for his anger.
VERSE:He didn’t spare their soul from death,
VERSE:but gave their life over to the pestilence,
LABEL:51
VERSE:and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,
VERSE:the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
LABEL:52
VERSE:But he led out his own people like sheep,
VERSE:and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
LABEL:53
VERSE:He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,
VERSE:but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
LABEL:54
VERSE:He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
VERSE:to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.
LABEL:55
VERSE:He also drove out the nations before them,
VERSE:allotted them for an inheritance by line,
VERSE:and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
LABEL:56
VERSE:Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,
VERSE:and didn’t keep his testimonies,
LABEL:57
VERSE:but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.
VERSE:They were twisted like a deceitful bow.
LABEL:58
VERSE:For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
VERSE:and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
LABEL:59
VERSE:When God heard this, he was angry,
VERSE:and greatly abhorred Israel,
LABEL:60
VERSE:so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,
VERSE:the tent which he placed among men,
LABEL:61
VERSE:and delivered his strength into captivity,
VERSE:his glory into the adversary’s hand.
LABEL:62
VERSE:He also gave his people over to the sword,
VERSE:and was angry with his inheritance.
LABEL:63
VERSE:Fire devoured their young men.
VERSE:Their virgins had no wedding song.
LABEL:64
VERSE:Their priests fell by the sword,
VERSE:and their widows couldn’t weep.
LABEL:65
VERSE:Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,
VERSE:like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.
LABEL:66
VERSE:He struck his adversaries backward.
VERSE:He put them to a perpetual reproach.
LABEL:67
VERSE:Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,
VERSE:and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,
LABEL:68
VERSE:But chose the tribe of Judah,
VERSE:Mount Zion which he loved.
LABEL:69
VERSE:He built his sanctuary like the heights,
VERSE:like the earth which he has established forever.
LABEL:70
VERSE:He also chose David his servant,
VERSE:and took him from the sheepfolds;
LABEL:71
VERSE:from following the ewes that have their young,
VERSE:he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,
VERSE:and Israel, his inheritance.
LABEL:72
VERSE:So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,
VERSE:and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
