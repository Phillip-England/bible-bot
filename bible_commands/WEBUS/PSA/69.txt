CHAPTER:69
TITLE:Psalms 69
LABEL:1
VERSE:Save me, God,
VERSE:for the waters have come up to my neck!
LABEL:2
VERSE:I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.
VERSE:I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I am weary with my crying.
VERSE:My throat is dry.
VERSE:My eyes fail looking for my God.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.
VERSE:Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty.
VERSE:I have to restore what I didn’t take away.
LABEL:5
VERSE:God, you know my foolishness.
VERSE:My sins aren’t hidden from you.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies.
VERSE:Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.
VERSE:Shame has covered my face.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I have become a stranger to my brothers,
VERSE:an alien to my mother’s children.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For the zeal of your house consumes me.
VERSE:The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:When I wept and I fasted,
VERSE:that was to my reproach.
LABEL:11
VERSE:When I made sackcloth my clothing,
VERSE:I became a byword to them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Those who sit in the gate talk about me.
VERSE:I am the song of the drunkards.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time.
VERSE:God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink.
VERSE:Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me,
VERSE:neither let the deep swallow me up.
VERSE:Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good.
VERSE:According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Don’t hide your face from your servant,
VERSE:for I am in distress.
VERSE:Answer me speedily!
LABEL:18
VERSE:Draw near to my soul and redeem it.
VERSE:Ransom me because of my enemies.
LABEL:19
VERSE:You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.
VERSE:My adversaries are all before you.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.
VERSE:I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
VERSE:for comforters, but I found none.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They also gave me poison for my food.
VERSE:In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Let their table before them become a snare.
VERSE:May it become a retribution and a trap.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see.
VERSE:Let their backs be continually bent.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Pour out your indignation on them.
VERSE:Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let their habitation be desolate.
VERSE:Let no one dwell in their tents.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For they persecute him whom you have wounded.
VERSE:They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Charge them with crime upon crime.
VERSE:Don’t let them come into your righteousness.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Let them be blotted out of the book of life,
VERSE:and not be written with the righteous.
LABEL:29
VERSE:But I am in pain and distress.
VERSE:Let your salvation, God, protect me.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I will praise the name of God with a song,
VERSE:and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
LABEL:31
VERSE:It will please Yahweh better than an ox,
VERSE:or a bull that has horns and hoofs.
LABEL:32
VERSE:The humble have seen it, and are glad.
VERSE:You who seek after God, let your heart live.
LABEL:33
VERSE:For Yahweh hears the needy,
VERSE:and doesn’t despise his captive people.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Let heaven and earth praise him;
VERSE:the seas, and everything that moves therein!
LABEL:35
VERSE:For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.
VERSE:They shall settle there, and own it.
LABEL:36
VERSE:The children also of his servants shall inherit it.
VERSE:Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
