LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh is my light and my salvation.
VERSE:Whom shall I fear?
VERSE:Yahweh is the strength of my life.
VERSE:Of whom shall I be afraid?
LABEL:2
VERSE:When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh,
VERSE:even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Though an army should encamp against me,
VERSE:my heart shall not fear.
VERSE:Though war should rise against me,
VERSE:even then I will be confident.
LABEL:4
VERSE:One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after:
VERSE:that I may dwell in Yahweh’s house all the days of my life,
VERSE:to see Yahweh’s beauty,
VERSE:and to inquire in his temple.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For in the day of trouble, he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.
VERSE:In the secret place of his tabernacle, he will hide me.
VERSE:He will lift me up on a rock.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.
VERSE:I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.
VERSE:I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.
VERSE:Have mercy also on me, and answer me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:When you said, “Seek my face,”
VERSE:my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Yahweh.”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Don’t hide your face from me.
VERSE:Don’t put your servant away in anger.
VERSE:You have been my help.
VERSE:Don’t abandon me,
VERSE:neither forsake me, God of my salvation.
LABEL:10
VERSE:When my father and my mother forsake me,
VERSE:then Yahweh will take me up.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Teach me your way, Yahweh.
VERSE:Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,
VERSE:for false witnesses have risen up against me,
VERSE:such as breathe out cruelty.
LABEL:13
VERSE:I am still confident of this:
VERSE:I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Wait for Yahweh.
VERSE:Be strong, and let your heart take courage.
VERSE:Yes, wait for Yahweh.
