CHAPTER:7
TITLE:John 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.
LABEL:3
VERSE:His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”
LABEL:5
VERSE:For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Jesus therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.
LABEL:8
VERSE:You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”
LABEL:12
VERSE:There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”
LABEL:13
VERSE:Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”
LABEL:16
VERSE:Jesus therefore answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”
LABEL:20
VERSE:The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”
LABEL:21
VERSE:Jesus answered them, “I did one work and you all marvel because of it.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”
LABEL:25
VERSE:Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?
LABEL:26
VERSE:Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?
LABEL:27
VERSE:However, we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”
LABEL:28
VERSE:Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know.
LABEL:29
VERSE:I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”
LABEL:30
VERSE:They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
LABEL:31
VERSE:But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”
LABEL:32
VERSE:The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Then Jesus said, “I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.
LABEL:34
VERSE:You will seek me and won’t find me. You can’t come where I am.”
LABEL:35
VERSE:The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
LABEL:36
VERSE:What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, and won’t find me;’ and ‘Where I am, you can’t come’?”
LABEL:37
VERSE:Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
LABEL:38
VERSE:He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”
LABEL:39
VERSE:But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”
LABEL:41
VERSE:Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?
LABEL:42
VERSE:Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring of David,  and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”
LABEL:43
VERSE:So a division arose in the multitude because of him.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.
LABEL:45
VERSE:The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?”
LABEL:46
VERSE:The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”
LABEL:47
VERSE:The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you?
LABEL:48
VERSE:Have any of the rulers or any of the Pharisees believed in him?
LABEL:49
VERSE:But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is cursed.”
LABEL:50
VERSE:Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,
LABEL:51
VERSE:“Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”
LABEL:52
VERSE:They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”
LABEL:53
VERSE:Everyone went to his own house,
