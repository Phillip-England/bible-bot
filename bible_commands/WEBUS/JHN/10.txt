CHAPTER:10
TITLE:John 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:  “Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn’t enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, is a thief and a robber.
LABEL:2
VERSE:But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don’t know the voice of strangers.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn’t understand what he was telling them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Jesus therefore said to them again, “Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep’s door.
LABEL:8
VERSE:All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out and will find pasture.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
LABEL:11
VERSE:  “I am the good shepherd.    The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and doesn’t care for the sheep.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own;
LABEL:15
VERSE:even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I have other sheep which are not of this fold.  I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,   that I may take it again.
LABEL:18
VERSE:No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.”
LABEL:19
VERSE:Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Many of them said, “He has a demon and is insane! Why do you listen to him?”
LABEL:21
VERSE:Others said, “These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn’t possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?”
LABEL:22
VERSE:It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.
LABEL:23
VERSE:It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, “How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
LABEL:25
VERSE:Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you don’t believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, these testify about me.
LABEL:26
VERSE:But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
LABEL:27
VERSE:My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
LABEL:29
VERSE:My Father who has given them to me is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I and the Father are one.”
LABEL:31
VERSE:Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?”
LABEL:33
VERSE:The Jews answered him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.”
LABEL:34
VERSE:Jesus answered them, “Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?
LABEL:35
VERSE:If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken),
LABEL:36
VERSE:do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?
LABEL:37
VERSE:If I don’t do the works of my Father, don’t believe me.
LABEL:38
VERSE:But if I do them, though you don’t believe me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”
LABEL:39
VERSE:They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.
LABEL:40
VERSE:He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Many came to him. They said, “John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true.”
LABEL:42
VERSE:Many believed in him there.
