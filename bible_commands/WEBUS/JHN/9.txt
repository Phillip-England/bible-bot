CHAPTER:9
TITLE:John 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
LABEL:3
VERSE:Jesus answered, “This man didn’t sin, nor did his parents, but that the works of God might be revealed in him.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
LABEL:5
VERSE:While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,
LABEL:7
VERSE:and said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Therefore the neighbors and those who saw that he was blind before said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”
VERSE:He said, “I am he.”
LABEL:10
VERSE:They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”
LABEL:11
VERSE:He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”
LABEL:12
VERSE:Then they asked him, “Where is he?”
VERSE:He said, “I don’t know.”
LABEL:13
VERSE:They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
LABEL:14
VERSE:It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”
VERSE:Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” So there was division among them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”
VERSE:He said, “He is a prophet.”
LABEL:18
VERSE:The Jews therefore didn’t believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
LABEL:19
VERSE:and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
LABEL:20
VERSE:His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
LABEL:21
VERSE:but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”
LABEL:22
VERSE:His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”
LABEL:24
VERSE:So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”
LABEL:25
VERSE:He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”
LABEL:26
VERSE:They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
LABEL:27
VERSE:He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”
LABEL:28
VERSE:They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
LABEL:29
VERSE:We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”
LABEL:30
VERSE:The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
LABEL:31
VERSE:We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
LABEL:33
VERSE:If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
LABEL:34
VERSE:They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” Then they threw him out.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of God?”
LABEL:36
VERSE:He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”
LABEL:37
VERSE:Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”
LABEL:38
VERSE:He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”
LABEL:40
VERSE:Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”
LABEL:41
VERSE:Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.
