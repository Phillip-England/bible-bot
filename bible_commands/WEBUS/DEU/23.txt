LABEL:4

LABEL:6
VERSE:You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.

LABEL:13
VERSE:You shall have a trowel among your weapons. It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement;
LABEL:14
VERSE:for Yahweh your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you. Therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
LABEL:15
VERSE:You shall not deliver to his master a servant who has escaped from his master to you.

VERSE:You shall not lend on interest to your brother: interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest.
LABEL:20

VERSE:When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it, for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.
