CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Philemon 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
LABEL:2
VERSE:to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
LABEL:5
VERSE:hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
LABEL:6
VERSE:that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,
LABEL:9
VERSE:yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,
LABEL:11
VERSE:who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
LABEL:13
VERSE:whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever,
LABEL:16
VERSE:no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
LABEL:17
VERSE:If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).
LABEL:20
VERSE:Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
LABEL:24
VERSE:as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
