CHAPTER:23
TITLE:Jeremiah 23
LABEL:1
VERSE:“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says Yahweh.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says against the shepherds who feed my people: “You have scattered my flock, driven them away, and have not visited them. Behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:3
VERSE:“I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither will any be lacking,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:5
VERSE:“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“that I will raise to David a righteous Branch;
VERSE:and he will reign as king and deal wisely,
VERSE:and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In his days Judah will be saved,
VERSE:and Israel will dwell safely.
VERSE:This is his name by which he will be called:
VERSE:Yahweh our righteousness.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that they will no more say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’
LABEL:8
VERSE:but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will dwell in their own land.”
LABEL:9
VERSE:Concerning the prophets:
VERSE:My heart within me is broken.
VERSE:All my bones shake.
VERSE:I am like a drunken man,
VERSE:and like a man whom wine has overcome,
VERSE:because of Yahweh,
VERSE:and because of his holy words.
LABEL:10
VERSE:“For the land is full of adulterers;
VERSE:for because of the curse the land mourns.
VERSE:The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.
VERSE:Their course is evil,
VERSE:and their might is not right;
LABEL:11
VERSE:for both prophet and priest are profane.
VERSE:Yes, in my house I have found their wickedness,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness.
VERSE:They will be driven on,
VERSE:and fall therein;
VERSE:for I will bring evil on them,
VERSE:even the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria.
VERSE:They prophesied by Baal,
VERSE:and caused my people Israel to err.
LABEL:14
VERSE:In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing:
VERSE:they commit adultery and walk in lies.
VERSE:They strengthen the hands of evildoers,
VERSE:so that no one returns from his wickedness.
VERSE:They have all become to me as Sodom,
VERSE:and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.”
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh of Armies says concerning the prophets:
VERSE:“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
VERSE:and make them drink poisoned water;
VERSE:for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yahweh of Armies says,
VERSE:“Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.
VERSE:They teach you vanity.
VERSE:They speak a vision of their own heart,
VERSE:and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They say continually to those who despise me,
VERSE:‘Yahweh has said, “You will have peace;”’
VERSE:and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say,
VERSE:‘No evil will come on you.’
LABEL:18
VERSE:For who has stood in the council of Yahweh,
VERSE:that he should perceive and hear his word?
VERSE:Who has listened to my word, and heard it?
LABEL:19
VERSE:Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out.
VERSE:Yes, a whirling storm!
VERSE:It will burst on the head of the wicked.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Yahweh’s anger will not return until he has executed
VERSE:and performed the intents of his heart.
VERSE:In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.
LABEL:21
VERSE:I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.
VERSE:I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But if they had stood in my council,
VERSE:then they would have caused my people to hear my words,
VERSE:and would have turned them from their evil way,
VERSE:and from the evil of their doings.
LABEL:23
VERSE:“Am I a God at hand,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“and not a God afar off?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Can anyone hide himself in secret places
VERSE:so that I can’t see him?” says Yahweh.
VERSE:“Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” says Yahweh.
LABEL:25
VERSE:“I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’
LABEL:26
VERSE:How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
LABEL:27
VERSE:They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name because of Baal.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat?” says Yahweh.
LABEL:29
VERSE:“Isn’t my word like fire?” says Yahweh; “and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
LABEL:30
VERSE:“Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who each steal my words from his neighbor.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who use their tongues, and say, ‘He says.’
LABEL:32
VERSE:Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” says Yahweh, “who tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting; yet I didn’t send them or command them. They don’t profit this people at all,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:33
VERSE:“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from Yahweh?’ Then you shall tell them, ‘“What message? I will cast you off,” says Yahweh.’
LABEL:34
VERSE:As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, ‘The message from Yahweh,’ I will even punish that man and his household.
LABEL:35
VERSE:You will say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh said?’
LABEL:36
VERSE:You will mention the message from Yahweh no more, for every man’s own word has become his message; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies, our God.
LABEL:37
VERSE:You will say to the prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’
LABEL:38
VERSE:Although you say, ‘The message from Yahweh,’ therefore Yahweh says: ‘Because you say this word, “The message from Yahweh,” and I have sent to you, telling you not to say, “The message from Yahweh,”
LABEL:39
VERSE:therefore behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence.
LABEL:40
VERSE:I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.’”
