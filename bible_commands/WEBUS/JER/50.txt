VERSE:The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Declare among the nations and publish,
VERSE:and set up a standard;
VERSE:publish, and don’t conceal;
VERSE:say, ‘Babylon has been taken,
VERSE:Bel is disappointed,
VERSE:Merodach is dismayed!
VERSE:Her images are disappointed.
VERSE:Her idols are dismayed.’
LABEL:3
VERSE:For a nation comes up out of the north against her,
VERSE:which will make her land desolate,
VERSE:and no one will dwell in it.
VERSE:They have fled.
VERSE:They are gone,
VERSE:both man and animal.
LABEL:4
VERSE:“In those days, and in that time,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“the children of Israel will come,
VERSE:they and the children of Judah together;
VERSE:they will go on their way weeping,
VERSE:and will seek Yahweh their God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They will inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it,
VERSE:saying, ‘Come, and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant
VERSE:that will not be forgotten.’
LABEL:6
VERSE:My people have been lost sheep.
VERSE:Their shepherds have caused them to go astray.
VERSE:They have turned them away on the mountains.
VERSE:They have gone from mountain to hill.
VERSE:They have forgotten their resting place.
LABEL:7
VERSE:All who found them have devoured them.
VERSE:Their adversaries said, ‘We are not guilty,
VERSE:because they have sinned against Yahweh,
VERSE:the habitation of righteousness,
VERSE:even Yahweh, the hope of their fathers.’
LABEL:8
VERSE:“Flee out of the middle of Babylon!
VERSE:Go out of the land of the Chaldeans,
VERSE:and be as the male goats before the flocks.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For, behold, I will stir up
VERSE:and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country;
VERSE:and they will set themselves in array against her.
VERSE:She will be taken from there.
VERSE:Their arrows will be as of an expert mighty man.
VERSE:None of them will return in vain.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Chaldea will be a prey.
VERSE:All who prey on her will be satisfied,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“Because you are glad,
VERSE:because you rejoice,
VERSE:O you who plunder my heritage,
VERSE:because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain,
VERSE:and neigh as strong horses,
LABEL:12
VERSE:your mother will be utterly disappointed.
VERSE:She who bore you will be confounded.
VERSE:Behold, she will be the least of the nations,
VERSE:a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Because of Yahweh’s wrath she won’t be inhabited,
VERSE:but she will be wholly desolate.
VERSE:Everyone who goes by Babylon will be astonished,
VERSE:and hiss at all her plagues.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around,
VERSE:all you who bend the bow;
VERSE:shoot at her.
VERSE:Spare no arrows,
VERSE:for she has sinned against Yahweh.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Shout against her all around.
VERSE:She has submitted herself.
VERSE:Her bulwarks have fallen.
VERSE:Her walls have been thrown down,
VERSE:for it is the vengeance of Yahweh.
VERSE:Take vengeance on her.
VERSE:As she has done, do to her.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Cut off the sower from Babylon,
VERSE:and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest.
VERSE:For fear of the oppressing sword,
VERSE:they will each return to their own people,
VERSE:and they will each flee to their own land.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“Israel is a hunted sheep.
VERSE:The lions have driven him away.
VERSE:First, the king of Assyria devoured him,
VERSE:and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.”
LABEL:18
VERSE:Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says:
VERSE:“Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,
VERSE:as I have punished the king of Assyria.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I will bring Israel again to his pasture,
VERSE:and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan.
VERSE:His soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In those days, and in that time,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“the iniquity of Israel will be sought for,
VERSE:and there will be none,
VERSE:also the sins of Judah,
VERSE:and they won’t be found;
VERSE:for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
LABEL:21
VERSE:“Go up against the land of Merathaim,
VERSE:even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod.
VERSE:Kill and utterly destroy after them,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“and do according to all that I have commanded you.
LABEL:22
VERSE:A sound of battle is in the land,
VERSE:and of great destruction.
LABEL:23
VERSE:How the hammer of the whole earth is cut apart and broken!
VERSE:How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!
LABEL:24
VERSE:I have laid a snare for you,
VERSE:and you are also taken, Babylon,
VERSE:and you weren’t aware.
VERSE:You are found,
VERSE:and also caught,
VERSE:because you have fought against Yahweh.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Yahweh has opened his armory,
VERSE:and has brought out the weapons of his indignation;
VERSE:for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Come against her from the farthest border.
VERSE:Open her storehouses.
VERSE:Cast her up as heaps.
VERSE:Destroy her utterly.
VERSE:Let nothing of her be left.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Kill all her bulls.
VERSE:Let them go down to the slaughter.
VERSE:Woe to them! For their day has come,
VERSE:the time of their visitation.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Listen to those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon,
VERSE:to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God,
VERSE:the vengeance of his temple.
LABEL:29
VERSE:“Call together the archers against Babylon,
VERSE:all those who bend the bow.
VERSE:Encamp against her all around.
VERSE:Let none of it escape.
VERSE:Pay her back according to her work.
VERSE:According to all that she has done, do to her;
VERSE:for she has been proud against Yahweh,
VERSE:against the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Therefore her young men will fall in her streets.
VERSE:All her men of war will be brought to silence in that day,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:31
VERSE:“Behold, I am against you, you proud one,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies;
VERSE:“for your day has come,
VERSE:the time that I will visit you.
LABEL:32
VERSE:The proud one will stumble and fall,
VERSE:and no one will raise him up.
VERSE:I will kindle a fire in his cities,
VERSE:and it will devour all who are around him.”
LABEL:33
VERSE:Yahweh of Armies says: “The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together.
VERSE:All who took them captive hold them fast.
VERSE:They refuse to let them go.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Their Redeemer is strong.
VERSE:Yahweh of Armies is his name.
VERSE:He will thoroughly plead their cause,
VERSE:that he may give rest to the earth,
VERSE:and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
LABEL:35
VERSE:“A sword is on the Chaldeans,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“and on the inhabitants of Babylon,
VERSE:on her princes,
VERSE:and on her wise men.
LABEL:36
VERSE:A sword is on the boasters,
VERSE:and they will become fools.
VERSE:A sword is on her mighty men,
VERSE:and they will be dismayed.
LABEL:37
VERSE:A sword is on their horses,
VERSE:on their chariots,
VERSE:and on all the mixed people who are in the middle of her;
VERSE:and they will become as women.
VERSE:A sword is on her treasures,
VERSE:and they will be robbed.
LABEL:38
VERSE:A drought is on her waters,
VERSE:and they will be dried up;
VERSE:for it is a land of engraved images,
VERSE:and they are mad over idols.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Therefore the wild animals of the desert
VERSE:with the wolves will dwell there.
VERSE:The ostriches will dwell therein.
VERSE:It will be inhabited no more forever,
VERSE:neither will it be lived in from generation to generation.
LABEL:40
VERSE:As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbor cities,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“so no man will dwell there,
VERSE:neither will any son of man live therein.
LABEL:41
VERSE:“Behold, a people comes from the north.
VERSE:A great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
LABEL:42
VERSE:They take up bow and spear.
VERSE:They are cruel, and have no mercy.
VERSE:Their voice roars like the sea.
VERSE:They ride on horses,
VERSE:everyone set in array,
VERSE:as a man to the battle,
VERSE:against you, daughter of Babylon.
LABEL:43
VERSE:The king of Babylon has heard the news of them,
VERSE:and his hands become feeble.
VERSE:Anguish has taken hold of him,
VERSE:pains as of a woman in labor.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Behold, the enemy will come up like a lion
VERSE:from the thickets of the Jordan against the strong habitation;
VERSE:for I will suddenly make them run away from it.
VERSE:Whoever is chosen,
VERSE:I will appoint him over it,
VERSE:for who is like me?
VERSE:Who will appoint me a time?
VERSE:Who is the shepherd who can stand before me?”
LABEL:45
VERSE:Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh
VERSE:that he has taken against Babylon;
VERSE:and his purposes
VERSE:that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans:
VERSE:Surely they will drag them away,
VERSE:even the little ones of the flock.
VERSE:Surely he will make their habitation desolate over them.
LABEL:46
VERSE:The earth trembles at the noise of the taking of Babylon.
VERSE:The cry is heard among the nations.
