TITLE:Jeremiah 48
LABEL:1
VERSE:Of Moab. Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says:
VERSE:“Woe to Nebo!
VERSE:For it is laid waste.
VERSE:Kiriathaim is disappointed.
VERSE:It is taken.
VERSE:Misgab is put to shame
VERSE:and broken down.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The praise of Moab is no more.
VERSE:In Heshbon they have devised evil against her:
VERSE:‘Come! Let’s cut her off from being a nation.’
VERSE:You also, Madmen, will be brought to silence.
VERSE:The sword will pursue you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The sound of a cry from Horonaim,
VERSE:desolation and great destruction!
LABEL:4
VERSE:Moab is destroyed.
VERSE:Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping.
VERSE:For at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Flee! Save your lives!
VERSE:Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,
VERSE:you also will be taken.
VERSE:Chemosh will go out into captivity,
VERSE:his priests and his princes together.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The destroyer will come on every city,
VERSE:and no city will escape;
VERSE:the valley also will perish,
VERSE:and the plain will be destroyed, as Yahweh has spoken.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Give wings to Moab,
VERSE:that she may fly and get herself away:
VERSE:and her cities will become a desolation,
VERSE:without anyone to dwell in them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:“Cursed is he who does the work of Yahweh negligently;
VERSE:and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“Moab has been at ease from his youth,
VERSE:and he has settled on his dregs,
VERSE:and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
VERSE:neither has he gone into captivity;
VERSE:therefore his taste remains in him,
VERSE:and his scent is not changed.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“that I will send to him those who pour off,
VERSE:and they will pour him off;
VERSE:and they will empty his vessels,
VERSE:and break their containers in pieces.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,
VERSE:as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
LABEL:14
VERSE:“How do you say, ‘We are mighty men,
VERSE:and valiant men for the war’?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Moab is laid waste,
VERSE:and they have gone up into his cities,
VERSE:and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,”
VERSE:says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.
LABEL:16
VERSE:“The calamity of Moab is near to come,
VERSE:and his affliction hurries fast.
LABEL:17
VERSE:All you who are around him, bemoan him;
VERSE:and all you who know his name, say,
VERSE:‘How the strong staff is broken,
VERSE:the beautiful rod!’
LABEL:18
VERSE:“You daughter who dwells in Dibon,
VERSE:come down from your glory,
VERSE:and sit in thirst;
VERSE:for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you.
VERSE:He has destroyed your strongholds.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch.
VERSE:Ask him who flees, and her who escapes;
VERSE:say, ‘What has been done?’
LABEL:20
VERSE:Moab is disappointed;
VERSE:for it is broken down.
VERSE:Wail and cry!
VERSE:Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Judgment has come on the plain country—
VERSE:on Holon, on Jahzah, on Mephaath,
LABEL:22
VERSE:on Dibon, on Nebo, on Beth Diblathaim,
LABEL:23
VERSE:on Kiriathaim, on Beth Gamul, on Beth Meon,
LABEL:24
VERSE:on Kerioth, on Bozrah,
VERSE:and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The horn of Moab is cut off,
VERSE:and his arm is broken,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:26
VERSE:“Make him drunk,
VERSE:for he magnified himself against Yahweh.
VERSE:Moab will wallow in his vomit,
VERSE:and he also will be in derision.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For wasn’t Israel a derision to you?
VERSE:Was he found among thieves?
VERSE:For as often as you speak of him,
VERSE:you shake your head.
LABEL:28
VERSE:You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock.
VERSE:Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.
LABEL:29
VERSE:“We have heard of the pride of Moab.
VERSE:He is very proud in his loftiness, his pride,
VERSE:his arrogance, and the arrogance of his heart.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I know his wrath,” says Yahweh, “that it is nothing;
VERSE:his boastings have done nothing.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Therefore I will wail for Moab.
VERSE:Yes, I will cry out for all Moab.
VERSE:They will mourn for the men of Kir Heres.
LABEL:32
VERSE:With more than the weeping of Jazer
VERSE:I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah.
VERSE:Your branches passed over the sea.
VERSE:They reached even to the sea of Jazer.
VERSE:The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits
VERSE:and on your vintage.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field
VERSE:and from the land of Moab.
VERSE:I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses.
VERSE:No one will tread with shouting.
VERSE:The shouting will be no shouting.
LABEL:34
VERSE:From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh,
VERSE:even to Jahaz they have uttered their voice,
VERSE:from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah;
VERSE:for the waters of Nimrim will also become desolate.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“him who offers in the high place,
VERSE:and him who burns incense to his gods.
LABEL:36
VERSE:Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like flutes,
VERSE:and my heart sounds like flutes for the men of Kir Heres.
VERSE:Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.
LABEL:37
VERSE:For every head is bald,
VERSE:and every beard clipped.
VERSE:There are cuttings on all the hands,
VERSE:and sackcloth on the waist.
LABEL:38
VERSE:On all the housetops of Moab,
VERSE:and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere;
VERSE:for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:39
VERSE:“How it is broken down!
VERSE:How they wail!
VERSE:How Moab has turned the back with shame!
VERSE:So will Moab become a derision
VERSE:and a terror to all who are around him.”
LABEL:40
VERSE:For Yahweh says: “Behold, he will fly as an eagle,
VERSE:and will spread out his wings against Moab.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Kerioth is taken,
VERSE:and the strongholds are seized.
VERSE:The heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day
VERSE:will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Moab will be destroyed from being a people,
VERSE:because he has magnified himself against Yahweh.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you,
VERSE:inhabitant of Moab,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:44
VERSE:“He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;
VERSE:and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare,
VERSE:for I will bring on him, even on Moab,
VERSE:the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:45
VERSE:“Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;
VERSE:for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,
VERSE:and a flame from the middle of Sihon,
VERSE:and has devoured the corner of Moab,
VERSE:and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
LABEL:46
VERSE:Woe to you, O Moab!
VERSE:The people of Chemosh are undone;
VERSE:for your sons are taken away captive,
VERSE:and your daughters into captivity.
LABEL:47
VERSE:“Yet I will reverse the captivity of Moab in the latter days,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
VERSE:Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
