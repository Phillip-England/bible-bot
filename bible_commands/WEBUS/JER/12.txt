BOOK:JER
CHAPTER:12
TITLE:Jeremiah 12
LABEL:1
VERSE:You are righteous, Yahweh,
VERSE:when I contend with you;
VERSE:yet I would like to plead a case with you.
VERSE:Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
VERSE:Why are they all at ease who deal very treacherously?
LABEL:2
VERSE:You have planted them. Yes, they have taken root.
VERSE:They grow. Yes, they produce fruit.
VERSE:You are near in their mouth,
VERSE:and far from their heart.
LABEL:3
VERSE:But you, Yahweh, know me.
VERSE:You see me, and test my heart toward you.
VERSE:Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,
VERSE:and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
LABEL:4
VERSE:How long will the land mourn,
VERSE:and the herbs of the whole country wither?
VERSE:Because of the wickedness of those who dwell therein,
VERSE:the animals and birds are consumed;
VERSE:because they said,
VERSE:“He won’t see our latter end.”
LABEL:5
VERSE:“If you have run with the footmen,
VERSE:and they have wearied you,
VERSE:then how can you contend with horses?
VERSE:Though in a land of peace you are secure,
VERSE:yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?
LABEL:6
VERSE:For even your brothers, and the house of your father,
VERSE:even they have dealt treacherously with you!
VERSE:Even they have cried aloud after you!
VERSE:Don’t believe them,
VERSE:though they speak beautiful words to you.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“I have forsaken my house.
VERSE:I have cast off my heritage.
VERSE:I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
LABEL:8
VERSE:My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest.
VERSE:She has uttered her voice against me.
VERSE:Therefore I have hated her.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey?
VERSE:Are the birds of prey against her all around?
VERSE:Go, assemble all the animals of the field.
VERSE:Bring them to devour.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard.
VERSE:They have trodden my portion under foot.
VERSE:They have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They have made it a desolation.
VERSE:It mourns to me, being desolate.
VERSE:The whole land is made desolate,
VERSE:because no one cares.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness;
VERSE:for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land.
VERSE:No flesh has peace.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They have sown wheat,
VERSE:and have reaped thorns.
VERSE:They have exhausted themselves,
VERSE:and profit nothing.
VERSE:You will be ashamed of your fruits,
VERSE:because of Yahweh’s fierce anger.”
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yahweh says, “Concerning all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
LABEL:15
VERSE:It will happen that after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them. I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It will happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘As Yahweh lives;’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the middle of my people.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it,” says Yahweh.
