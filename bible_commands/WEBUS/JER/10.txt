CHAPTER:10
TITLE:Jeremiah 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!
LABEL:2
VERSE:Yahweh says,
VERSE:“Don’t learn the way of the nations,
VERSE:and don’t be dismayed at the signs of the sky;
VERSE:for the nations are dismayed at them.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the customs of the peoples are vanity;
VERSE:for one cuts a tree out of the forest,
VERSE:the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They deck it with silver and with gold.
VERSE:They fasten it with nails and with hammers,
VERSE:so that it can’t move.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They are like a palm tree, of turned work,
VERSE:and don’t speak.
VERSE:They must be carried,
VERSE:because they can’t move.
VERSE:Don’t be afraid of them;
VERSE:for they can’t do evil,
VERSE:neither is it in them to do good.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:There is no one like you, Yahweh.
VERSE:You are great,
VERSE:and your name is great in might.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Who shouldn’t fear you,
VERSE:King of the nations?
VERSE:For it belongs to you.
VERSE:Because among all the wise men of the nations,
VERSE:and in all their royal estate,
VERSE:there is no one like you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But they are together brutish and foolish,
VERSE:instructed by idols!
VERSE:It is just wood.
LABEL:9
VERSE:There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,
VERSE:and gold from Uphaz,
VERSE:the work of the engraver and of the hands of the goldsmith.
VERSE:Their clothing is blue and purple.
VERSE:They are all the work of skillful men.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But Yahweh is the true God.
VERSE:He is the living God,
VERSE:and an everlasting King.
VERSE:At his wrath, the earth trembles.
VERSE:The nations aren’t able to withstand his indignation.
LABEL:11
VERSE:“You shall say this to them: ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.’”
LABEL:12
VERSE:God has made the earth by his power.
VERSE:He has established the world by his wisdom,
VERSE:and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens.
LABEL:13
VERSE:When he utters his voice,
VERSE:the waters in the heavens roar,
VERSE:and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.
VERSE:He makes lightnings for the rain,
VERSE:and brings the wind out of his treasuries.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Every man has become brutish and without knowledge.
VERSE:Every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;
VERSE:for his molten image is falsehood,
VERSE:and there is no breath in them.
LABEL:15
VERSE:They are vanity, a work of delusion.
VERSE:In the time of their visitation they will perish.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The portion of Jacob is not like these;
VERSE:for he is the maker of all things;
VERSE:and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance.
VERSE:Yahweh of Armies is his name.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Gather up your wares out of the land,
VERSE:you who live under siege.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For Yahweh says,
VERSE:“Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time,
VERSE:and will distress them, that they may feel it.”
LABEL:19
VERSE:Woe is me because of my injury!
VERSE:My wound is serious;
VERSE:but I said,
VERSE:“Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.”
LABEL:20
VERSE:My tent has been destroyed,
VERSE:and all my cords are broken.
VERSE:My children have gone away from me, and they are no more.
VERSE:There is no one to spread my tent any more,
VERSE:to set up my curtains.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the shepherds have become brutish,
VERSE:and have not inquired of Yahweh.
VERSE:Therefore they have not prospered,
VERSE:and all their flocks have scattered.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The voice of news, behold, it comes,
VERSE:and a great commotion out of the north country,
VERSE:to make the cities of Judah a desolation,
VERSE:a dwelling place of jackals.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself.
VERSE:It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Yahweh, correct me, but gently;
VERSE:not in your anger,
VERSE:lest you reduce me to nothing.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
VERSE:and on the families that don’t call on your name;
VERSE:for they have devoured Jacob.
VERSE:Yes, they have devoured him, consumed him,
VERSE:and have laid waste his habitation.
