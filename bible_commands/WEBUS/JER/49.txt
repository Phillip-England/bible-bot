CHAPTER:49
TITLE:Jeremiah 49
LABEL:1
VERSE:Of the children of Ammon. Yahweh says:
VERSE:“Has Israel no sons?
VERSE:Has he no heir?
VERSE:Why then does Malcam possess Gad,
VERSE:and his people dwell in its cities?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Therefore behold, the days come,”
VERSE:says Yahweh,
VERSE:“that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
VERSE:and it will become a desolate heap,
VERSE:and her daughters will be burned with fire;
VERSE:then Israel will possess those who possessed him,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
LABEL:3
VERSE:“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste!
VERSE:Cry, you daughters of Rabbah!
VERSE:Clothe yourself in sackcloth.
VERSE:Lament, and run back and forth among the fences;
VERSE:for Malcam will go into captivity,
VERSE:his priests and his princes together.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Why do you boast in the valleys,
VERSE:your flowing valley, backsliding daughter?
VERSE:You trusted in her treasures,
VERSE:saying, ‘Who will come to me?’
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, I will bring a terror on you,”
VERSE:says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,
VERSE:“from all who are around you.
VERSE:All of you will be driven completely out,
VERSE:and there will be no one to gather together the fugitives.
LABEL:6
VERSE:“But afterward I will reverse the captivity of the children of Ammon,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Of Edom, Yahweh of Armies says:
VERSE:“Is wisdom no more in Teman?
VERSE:Has counsel perished from the prudent?
VERSE:Has their wisdom vanished?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Flee! Turn back!
VERSE:Dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan;
VERSE:for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him when I visit him.
LABEL:9
VERSE:If grape gatherers came to you,
VERSE:would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
VERSE:If thieves came by night,
VERSE:wouldn’t they steal until they had enough?
LABEL:10
VERSE:But I have made Esau bare,
VERSE:I have uncovered his secret places,
VERSE:and he will not be able to hide himself.
VERSE:His offspring is destroyed,
VERSE:with his brothers and his neighbors;
VERSE:and he is no more.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Leave your fatherless children.
VERSE:I will preserve them alive.
VERSE:Let your widows trust in me.”
LABEL:12
VERSE:For Yahweh says: “Behold, they to whom it didn’t pertain to drink of the cup will certainly drink; and are you he who will altogether go unpunished? You won’t go unpunished, but you will surely drink.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For I have sworn by myself,” says Yahweh, “that Bozrah will become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse. All its cities will be perpetual wastes.”
LABEL:14
VERSE:I have heard news from Yahweh,
VERSE:and an ambassador is sent among the nations,
VERSE:saying, “Gather yourselves together!
VERSE:Come against her!
VERSE:Rise up to the battle!”
LABEL:15
VERSE:“For, behold, I have made you small among the nations,
VERSE:and despised among men.
LABEL:16
VERSE:As for your terror,
VERSE:the pride of your heart has deceived you,
VERSE:O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
VERSE:who hold the height of the hill,
VERSE:though you should make your nest as high as the eagle,
VERSE:I will bring you down from there,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“Edom will become an astonishment.
VERSE:Everyone who passes by it will be astonished,
VERSE:and will hiss at all its plagues.
LABEL:18
VERSE:As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbor cities,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“no man will dwell there,
VERSE:neither will any son of man live therein.
LABEL:19
VERSE:“Behold, he will come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation;
VERSE:for I will suddenly make them run away from it,
VERSE:and whoever is chosen,
VERSE:I will appoint him over it.
VERSE:For who is like me?
VERSE:Who will appoint me a time?
VERSE:Who is the shepherd who will stand before me?”
LABEL:20
VERSE:Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom,
VERSE:and his purposes that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
VERSE:Surely they will drag them away,
VERSE:the little ones of the flock.
VERSE:Surely he will make their habitation desolate over them.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The earth trembles at the noise of their fall;
VERSE:there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Red Sea.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Behold, he will come up and fly as the eagle,
VERSE:and spread out his wings against Bozrah.
VERSE:The heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Of Damascus:
VERSE:“Hamath and Arpad are confounded,
VERSE:for they have heard evil news.
VERSE:They have melted away.
VERSE:There is sorrow on the sea.
VERSE:It can’t be quiet.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Damascus has grown feeble,
VERSE:she turns herself to flee,
VERSE:and trembling has seized her.
VERSE:Anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her,
VERSE:as of a woman in travail.
LABEL:25
VERSE:How is the city of praise not forsaken,
VERSE:the city of my joy?
LABEL:26
VERSE:Therefore her young men will fall in her streets,
VERSE:and all the men of war will be brought to silence in that day,”
VERSE:says Yahweh of Armies.
LABEL:27
VERSE:“I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,
VERSE:and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.”
LABEL:28
VERSE:Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck, Yahweh says:
VERSE:“Arise, go up to Kedar,
VERSE:and destroy the children of the east.
LABEL:29
VERSE:They will take their tents and their flocks.
VERSE:they will carry away for themselves their curtains,
VERSE:all their vessels, and their camels;
VERSE:and they will cry to them, ‘Terror on every side!’
LABEL:30
VERSE:Flee!
VERSE:Wander far off!
VERSE:Dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor,” says Yahweh;
VERSE:“for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you,
VERSE:and has conceived a purpose against you.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Arise! Go up to a nation that is at ease,
VERSE:that dwells without care,” says Yahweh;
VERSE:“that has neither gates nor bars,
VERSE:that dwells alone.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Their camels will be a booty,
VERSE:and the multitude of their livestock a plunder.
VERSE:I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off;
VERSE:and I will bring their calamity from every side of them,”
VERSE:says Yahweh.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Hazor will be a dwelling place of jackals,
VERSE:a desolation forever.
VERSE:No man will dwell there,
VERSE:neither will any son of man live therein.”
LABEL:34
VERSE:Yahweh’s word that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
LABEL:35
VERSE:“Yahweh of Armies says:
VERSE:‘Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,
VERSE:the chief of their might.
LABEL:36
VERSE:I will bring on Elam the four winds from the four quarters of the sky,
VERSE:and will scatter them toward all those winds.
VERSE:There will be no nation where the outcasts of Elam will not come.
LABEL:37
VERSE:I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,
VERSE:and before those who seek their life.
VERSE:I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger,’ says Yahweh;
VERSE:‘and I will send the sword after them,
VERSE:until I have consumed them.
LABEL:38
VERSE:I will set my throne in Elam,
VERSE:and will destroy from there king and princes,’ says Yahweh.
LABEL:39
VERSE:‘But it will happen in the latter days
VERSE:that I will reverse the captivity of Elam,’ says Yahweh.”
