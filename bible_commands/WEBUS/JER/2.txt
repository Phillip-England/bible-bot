CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Jeremiah 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says,
VERSE:“I remember for you the kindness of your youth,
VERSE:your love as a bride,
VERSE:how you went after me in the wilderness,
VERSE:in a land that was not sown.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Israel was holiness to Yahweh,
VERSE:the first fruits of his increase.
VERSE:All who devour him will be held guilty.
VERSE:Evil will come on them,”’ says Yahweh.”
LABEL:4
VERSE:Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel!
LABEL:5
VERSE:Yahweh says,
VERSE:“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,
VERSE:that they have gone far from me,
VERSE:and have walked after worthless vanity,
VERSE:and have become worthless?
LABEL:6
VERSE:They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
VERSE:who led us through the wilderness,
VERSE:through a land of deserts and of pits,
VERSE:through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,
VERSE:through a land that no one passed through,
VERSE:and where no man lived?’
LABEL:7
VERSE:I brought you into a plentiful land
VERSE:to eat its fruit and its goodness;
VERSE:but when you entered, you defiled my land,
VERSE:and made my heritage an abomination.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’
VERSE:and those who handle the law didn’t know me.
VERSE:The rulers also transgressed against me,
VERSE:and the prophets prophesied by Baal
VERSE:and followed things that do not profit.
LABEL:9
VERSE:“Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“and I will contend with your children’s children.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see.
VERSE:Send to Kedar, and consider diligently,
VERSE:and see if there has been such a thing.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Has a nation changed its gods,
VERSE:which really are no gods?
VERSE:But my people have changed their glory for that which doesn’t profit.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“Be astonished, you heavens, at this
VERSE:and be horribly afraid.
VERSE:Be very desolate,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:13
VERSE:“For my people have committed two evils:
VERSE:they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters,
VERSE:and cut out cisterns for themselves: broken cisterns that can’t hold water.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Is Israel a slave?
VERSE:Is he born into slavery?
VERSE:Why has he become a captive?
LABEL:15
VERSE:The young lions have roared at him and raised their voices.
VERSE:They have made his land waste.
VERSE:His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.
LABEL:17
VERSE:“Haven’t you brought this on yourself,
VERSE:in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor?
VERSE:Or why do you go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
LABEL:19
VERSE:“Your own wickedness will correct you,
VERSE:and your backsliding will rebuke you.
VERSE:Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,
VERSE:that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,
VERSE:and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“For long ago I broke off your yoke,
VERSE:and burst your bonds.
VERSE:You said, ‘I will not serve;’
VERSE:for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself,
VERSE:playing the prostitute.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Yet I had planted you a noble vine,
VERSE:a pure and faithful seed.
VERSE:How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?
LABEL:22
VERSE:For though you wash yourself with lye,
VERSE:and use much soap,
VERSE:yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh.
LABEL:23
VERSE:“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled.
VERSE:I have not gone after the Baals’?
VERSE:See your way in the valley.
VERSE:Know what you have done.
VERSE:You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways,
LABEL:24
VERSE:a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving.
VERSE:When she is in heat, who can turn her away?
VERSE:All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.
LABEL:25
VERSE:“Keep your feet from being bare,
VERSE:and your throat from thirst.
VERSE:But you said, ‘It is in vain.
VERSE:No, for I have loved strangers,
VERSE:and I will go after them.’
LABEL:26
VERSE:As the thief is ashamed when he is found,
VERSE:so the house of Israel is ashamed—
VERSE:they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,
LABEL:27
VERSE:who tell wood, ‘You are my father,’
VERSE:and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me,’
VERSE:for they have turned their back to me,
VERSE:and not their face,
VERSE:but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us!’
LABEL:28
VERSE:“But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?
VERSE:Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble,
VERSE:for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.
LABEL:29
VERSE:“Why will you contend with me?
VERSE:You all have transgressed against me,” says Yahweh.
LABEL:30
VERSE:“I have struck your children in vain.
VERSE:They received no correction.
VERSE:Your own sword has devoured your prophets,
VERSE:like a destroying lion.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Generation, consider Yahweh’s word.
VERSE:Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
VERSE:Or a land of thick darkness?
VERSE:Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose.
VERSE:We will come to you no more’?
LABEL:32
VERSE:“Can a virgin forget her ornaments,
VERSE:or a bride her attire?
VERSE:Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.
LABEL:33
VERSE:How well you prepare your way to seek love!
VERSE:Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts.
VERSE:You didn’t find them breaking in,
VERSE:but it is because of all these things.
LABEL:35
VERSE:“Yet you said, ‘I am innocent.
VERSE:Surely his anger has turned away from me.’
VERSE:“Behold, I will judge you,
VERSE:because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
LABEL:36
VERSE:Why do you go about so much to change your ways?
VERSE:You will be ashamed of Egypt also,
VERSE:as you were ashamed of Assyria.
LABEL:37
VERSE:You will also leave that place with your hands on your head;
VERSE:for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,
VERSE:and you won’t prosper with them.
