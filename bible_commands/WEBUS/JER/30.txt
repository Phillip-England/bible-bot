LABEL:3
VERSE:For, behold, the days come,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will reverse the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’”
LABEL:4
VERSE:These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For Yahweh says:
VERSE:“We have heard a voice of trembling;
VERSE:a voice of fear, and not of peace.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child.
VERSE:Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,
VERSE:and all faces are turned pale?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it!
VERSE:It is even the time of Jacob’s trouble;
VERSE:but he will be saved out of it.
LABEL:8
VERSE:It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck,
VERSE:and will burst your bonds.
VERSE:Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;
LABEL:9
VERSE:but they will serve Yahweh their God,
VERSE:and David their king,
VERSE:whom I will raise up to them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh.
VERSE:Don’t be dismayed, Israel.
VERSE:For, behold, I will save you from afar,
VERSE:and save your offspring from the land of their captivity.
VERSE:Jacob will return,
VERSE:and will be quiet and at ease.
VERSE:No one will make him afraid.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you;
VERSE:for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,
VERSE:but I will not make a full end of you;
VERSE:but I will correct you in measure,
VERSE:and will in no way leave you unpunished.”

VERSE:For Yahweh says,
VERSE:“Your hurt is incurable.
VERSE:Your wound is grievous.

VERSE:There is no one to plead your cause,
VERSE:that you may be bound up.
VERSE:You have no healing medicines.
LABEL:14
VERSE:All your lovers have forgotten you.
VERSE:They don’t seek you.
VERSE:For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,
VERSE:with the chastisement of a cruel one,
VERSE:for the greatness of your iniquity,
VERSE:because your sins were increased.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Why do you cry over your injury?
VERSE:Your pain is incurable.
VERSE:For the greatness of your iniquity,
VERSE:because your sins have increased,
VERSE:I have done these things to you.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.
VERSE:All your adversaries, everyone of them, will go into captivity.
VERSE:Those who plunder you will be plunder.
VERSE:I will make all who prey on you become prey.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For I will restore health to you,
VERSE:and I will heal you of your wounds,” says Yahweh,
VERSE:“because they have called you an outcast,
VERSE:saying, ‘It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.’”

VERSE:Yahweh says:
VERSE:“Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob’s tents,
VERSE:and have compassion on his dwelling places.
VERSE:The city will be built on its own hill,
VERSE:and the palace will be inhabited in its own place.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thanksgiving will proceed out of them
VERSE:with the voice of those who make merry.
VERSE:I will multiply them,
VERSE:and they will not be few;
VERSE:I will also glorify them,
VERSE:and they will not be small.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Their children also will be as before,
VERSE:and their congregation will be established before me.
VERSE:I will punish all who oppress them.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Their prince will be one of them,
VERSE:and their ruler will proceed from among them.
VERSE:I will cause him to draw near,
VERSE:and he will approach me;
VERSE:for who is he who has had boldness to approach me?” says Yahweh.
LABEL:22
VERSE:“You shall be my people,
VERSE:and I will be your God.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out,
VERSE:a sweeping storm;
VERSE:it will burst on the head of the wicked.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return until he has accomplished,
VERSE:and until he has performed the intentions of his heart.
VERSE:In the latter days you will understand it.”
