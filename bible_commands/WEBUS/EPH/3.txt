VERSE:For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,
LABEL:2
VERSE:if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you,
LABEL:3
VERSE:how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,
LABEL:4
VERSE:by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,
LABEL:5
VERSE:which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,
LABEL:6
VERSE:that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,
LABEL:7
VERSE:of which I was made a servant according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.
LABEL:8
VERSE:To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
LABEL:9
VERSE:and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ,
LABEL:10
VERSE:to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,
LABEL:11
VERSE:according to the eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
LABEL:12
VERSE:In him we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.

VERSE:For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
LABEL:15
VERSE:from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
LABEL:16
VERSE:that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person,
LABEL:17
VERSE:that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
LABEL:18
VERSE:may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth,
LABEL:19
VERSE:and to know Christâ€™s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

VERSE:Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
LABEL:21
VERSE:to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
