BOOK:ZEC
CHAPTER:9
TITLE:Zechariah 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:A revelation.
VERSE:Yahweh’s word is against the land of Hadrach,
VERSE:and will rest upon Damascus—
VERSE:for the eye of man
VERSE:and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh—
LABEL:2
VERSE:and Hamath, also, which borders on it,
VERSE:Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Tyre built herself a stronghold,
VERSE:and heaped up silver like the dust,
VERSE:and fine gold like the mire of the streets.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Behold, the Lord will dispossess her,
VERSE:and he will strike her power in the sea;
VERSE:and she will be devoured with fire.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Ashkelon will see it, and fear;
VERSE:Gaza also, and will writhe in agony;
VERSE:as will Ekron, for her expectation will be disappointed;
VERSE:and the king will perish from Gaza,
VERSE:and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Foreigners will dwell in Ashdod,
VERSE:and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I will take away his blood out of his mouth,
VERSE:and his abominations from between his teeth;
VERSE:and he also will be a remnant for our God;
VERSE:and he will be as a chieftain in Judah,
VERSE:and Ekron as a Jebusite.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I will encamp around my house against the army,
VERSE:that no one pass through or return;
VERSE:and no oppressor will pass through them any more:
VERSE:for now I have seen with my eyes.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!
VERSE:Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!
VERSE:Behold, your King comes to you!
VERSE:He is righteous, and having salvation;
VERSE:lowly, and riding on a donkey,
VERSE:even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
VERSE:and the horse from Jerusalem.
VERSE:The battle bow will be cut off;
VERSE:and he will speak peace to the nations.
VERSE:His dominion will be from sea to sea,
VERSE:and from the River to the ends of the earth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:As for you also,
VERSE:because of the blood of your covenant,
VERSE:I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope!
VERSE:Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me.
VERSE:I have loaded the bow with Ephraim.
VERSE:I will stir up your sons, Zion,
VERSE:against your sons, Greece,
VERSE:and will make you like the sword of a mighty man.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yahweh will be seen over them.
VERSE:His arrow will flash like lightning.
VERSE:The Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet,
VERSE:and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Yahweh of Armies will defend them.
VERSE:They will destroy and overcome with sling stones.
VERSE:They will drink, and roar as through wine.
VERSE:They will be filled like bowls,
VERSE:like the corners of the altar.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people;
VERSE:for they are like the jewels of a crown,
VERSE:lifted on high over his land.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For how great is his goodness,
VERSE:and how great is his beauty!
VERSE:Grain will make the young men flourish,
VERSE:and new wine the virgins.
