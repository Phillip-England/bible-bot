CHAPTER:16
TITLE:1 Corinthians 16
LABEL:1
VERSE:Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.
LABEL:2
VERSE:On the first day of every week, let each one of you save as he may prosper, that no collections are made when I come.
LABEL:3
VERSE:When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.
LABEL:4
VERSE:If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
LABEL:6
VERSE:But with you it may be that I will stay with you, or even winter with you, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,
LABEL:9
VERSE:for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Now concerning Apollos the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!
LABEL:14
VERSE:Let all that you do be done in love.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Now I beg you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints—
LABEL:16
VERSE:that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.
LABEL:20
VERSE:All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
LABEL:21
VERSE:This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.
LABEL:22
VERSE:If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed. Come, Lord!
LABEL:23
VERSE:The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
LABEL:24
VERSE:My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
