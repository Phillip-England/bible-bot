VERSE:I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.

VERSE:Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

VERSE:For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.

VERSE:Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.

VERSE:If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,
