CHAPTER:5
TITLE:1 Peter 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed:
LABEL:2
VERSE:shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily; not for dishonest gain, but willingly;
LABEL:3
VERSE:not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.
LABEL:4
VERSE:When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility and subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,
LABEL:7
VERSE:casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
LABEL:11
VERSE:To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
LABEL:13
VERSE:She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you. So does Mark, my son.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Greet one another with a kiss of love.
VERSE:Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
