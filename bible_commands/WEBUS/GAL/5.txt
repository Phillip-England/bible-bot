CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Galatians 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
LABEL:4
VERSE:You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love.
LABEL:7
VERSE:You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?
LABEL:8
VERSE:This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
LABEL:9
VERSE:A little yeast grows through the whole lump.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
LABEL:15
VERSE:But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,
LABEL:20
VERSE:idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
LABEL:21
VERSE:envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,
LABEL:23
VERSE:gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
LABEL:25
VERSE:If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
