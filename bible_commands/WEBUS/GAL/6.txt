CHAPTER:6
TITLE:Galatians 6
LABEL:1
VERSE:Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For each man will bear his own burden.
LABEL:6
VERSE:But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season if we don’t give up.
LABEL:10
VERSE:So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.
LABEL:11
VERSE:See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.
LABEL:12
VERSE:As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.
LABEL:17
VERSE:From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
