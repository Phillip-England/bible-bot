BOOK:ROM
CHAPTER:10
TITLE:Romans 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:Brothers, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn’t subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, “The one who does them will live by them.”
LABEL:6
VERSE:But the righteousness which is of faith says this, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down);
LABEL:7
VERSE:or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)”
LABEL:8
VERSE:But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart;” that is, the word of faith which we preach:
LABEL:9
VERSE:that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For with the heart one believes resulting in righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made resulting in salvation.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”
LABEL:12
VERSE:For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
LABEL:14
VERSE:How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?
LABEL:15
VERSE:And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written:
VERSE:“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace,
VERSE:who bring glad tidings of good things!”
LABEL:16
VERSE:But they didn’t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”
LABEL:17
VERSE:So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But I say, didn’t they hear? Yes, most certainly,
VERSE:“Their sound went out into all the earth,
VERSE:their words to the ends of the world.”
LABEL:19
VERSE:But I ask, didn’t Israel know? First Moses says,
VERSE:“I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation.
VERSE:I will make you angry with a nation void of understanding.”
LABEL:20
VERSE:Isaiah is very bold and says,
VERSE:“I was found by those who didn’t seek me.
VERSE:I was revealed to those who didn’t ask for me.”
LABEL:21
VERSE:But about Israel he says, “All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”
