CHAPTER:25
TITLE:Proverbs 25
LABEL:1
VERSE:These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
LABEL:2
VERSE:It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,
VERSE:but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
LABEL:3
VERSE:As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
VERSE:so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Take away the dross from the silver,
VERSE:and material comes out for the refiner.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Take away the wicked from the king’s presence,
VERSE:and his throne will be established in righteousness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,
VERSE:or claim a place among great men;
LABEL:7
VERSE:for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”
VERSE:than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,
VERSE:whom your eyes have seen.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.
VERSE:What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Debate your case with your neighbor,
VERSE:and don’t betray the confidence of another,
LABEL:10
VERSE:lest one who hears it put you to shame,
VERSE:and your bad reputation never depart.
LABEL:11
VERSE:A word fitly spoken
VERSE:is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
LABEL:12
VERSE:As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
VERSE:so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.
LABEL:13
VERSE:As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
VERSE:so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;
VERSE:for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
LABEL:14
VERSE:As clouds and wind without rain,
VERSE:so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.
LABEL:15
VERSE:By patience a ruler is persuaded.
VERSE:A soft tongue breaks the bone.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Have you found honey?
VERSE:Eat as much as is sufficient for you,
VERSE:lest you eat too much, and vomit it.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,
VERSE:lest he be weary of you, and hate you.
LABEL:18
VERSE:A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor
VERSE:is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble
VERSE:is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.
LABEL:20
VERSE:As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,
VERSE:or vinegar on soda,
VERSE:so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
LABEL:21
VERSE:If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.
VERSE:If he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
LABEL:22
VERSE:for you will heap coals of fire on his head,
VERSE:and Yahweh will reward you.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The north wind produces rain;
VERSE:so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.
LABEL:24
VERSE:It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop
VERSE:than to share a house with a contentious woman.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Like cold water to a thirsty soul,
VERSE:so is good news from a far country.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,
VERSE:so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
LABEL:27
VERSE:It is not good to eat much honey,
VERSE:nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Like a city that is broken down and without walls
VERSE:is a man whose spirit is without restraint.
