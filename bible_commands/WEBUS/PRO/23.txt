CHAPTER:23
TITLE:Proverbs 23
LABEL:1
VERSE:When you sit to eat with a ruler,
VERSE:consider diligently what is before you;
LABEL:2
VERSE:put a knife to your throat
VERSE:if you are a man given to appetite.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Don’t be desirous of his dainties,
VERSE:since they are deceitful food.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Don’t weary yourself to be rich.
VERSE:In your wisdom, show restraint.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?
VERSE:For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,
VERSE:and don’t crave his delicacies,
LABEL:7
VERSE:for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.
VERSE:“Eat and drink!” he says to you,
VERSE:but his heart is not with you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten
VERSE:and waste your pleasant words.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Don’t speak in the ears of a fool,
VERSE:for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Don’t move the ancient boundary stone.
VERSE:Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
LABEL:11
VERSE:for their Defender is strong.
VERSE:He will plead their case against you.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Apply your heart to instruction,
VERSE:and your ears to the words of knowledge.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Don’t withhold correction from a child.
VERSE:If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Punish him with the rod,
VERSE:and save his soul from Sheol.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My son, if your heart is wise,
VERSE:then my heart will be glad, even mine.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Yes, my heart will rejoice
VERSE:when your lips speak what is right.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Don’t let your heart envy sinners,
VERSE:but rather fear Yahweh all day long.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Indeed surely there is a future hope,
VERSE:and your hope will not be cut off.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Listen, my son, and be wise,
VERSE:and keep your heart on the right path!
LABEL:20
VERSE:Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine,
VERSE:or those who gorge themselves on meat;
LABEL:21
VERSE:for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;
VERSE:and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Listen to your father who gave you life,
VERSE:and don’t despise your mother when she is old.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Buy the truth, and don’t sell it.
VERSE:Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The father of the righteous has great joy.
VERSE:Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let your father and your mother be glad!
VERSE:Let her who bore you rejoice!
LABEL:26
VERSE:My son, give me your heart;
VERSE:and let your eyes keep in my ways.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For a prostitute is a deep pit;
VERSE:and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,
VERSE:and increases the unfaithful among men.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Who has woe?
VERSE:Who has sorrow?
VERSE:Who has strife?
VERSE:Who has complaints?
VERSE:Who has needless bruises?
VERSE:Who has bloodshot eyes?
LABEL:30
VERSE:Those who stay long at the wine;
VERSE:those who go to seek out mixed wine.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Don’t look at the wine when it is red,
VERSE:when it sparkles in the cup,
VERSE:when it goes down smoothly.
LABEL:32
VERSE:In the end, it bites like a snake,
VERSE:and poisons like a viper.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Your eyes will see strange things,
VERSE:and your mind will imagine confusing things.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea,
VERSE:or as he who lies on top of the rigging:
LABEL:35
VERSE:“They hit me, and I was not hurt!
VERSE:They beat me, and I don’t feel it!
VERSE:When will I wake up? I can do it again.
VERSE:I will look for more.”
