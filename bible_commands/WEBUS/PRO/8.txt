TITLE:Proverbs 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:Doesn’t wisdom cry out?
VERSE:Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?
LABEL:2
VERSE:On the top of high places by the way,
VERSE:where the paths meet, she stands.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,
VERSE:at the entry doors, she cries aloud:
LABEL:4
VERSE:“I call to you men!
VERSE:I send my voice to the sons of mankind.
LABEL:5
VERSE:You simple, understand prudence!
VERSE:You fools, be of an understanding heart!
LABEL:6
VERSE:Hear, for I will speak excellent things.
VERSE:The opening of my lips is for right things.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For my mouth speaks truth.
VERSE:Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
LABEL:8
VERSE:All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
VERSE:There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They are all plain to him who understands,
VERSE:right to those who find knowledge.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Receive my instruction rather than silver,
VERSE:knowledge rather than choice gold.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For wisdom is better than rubies.
VERSE:All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.
LABEL:12
VERSE:“I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.
VERSE:Find out knowledge and discretion.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.
VERSE:I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.
VERSE:I have understanding and power.
LABEL:15
VERSE:By me kings reign,
VERSE:and princes decree justice.
LABEL:16
VERSE:By me princes rule,
VERSE:nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I love those who love me.
VERSE:Those who seek me diligently will find me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:With me are riches, honor,
VERSE:enduring wealth, and prosperity.
LABEL:19
VERSE:My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold,
VERSE:my yield than choice silver.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I walk in the way of righteousness,
VERSE:in the middle of the paths of justice,
LABEL:21
VERSE:that I may give wealth to those who love me.
VERSE:I fill their treasuries.
LABEL:22
VERSE:“Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work,
VERSE:before his deeds of old.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
VERSE:before the earth existed.
LABEL:24
VERSE:When there were no depths, I was born,
VERSE:when there were no springs abounding with water.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Before the mountains were settled in place,
VERSE:before the hills, I was born;
LABEL:26
VERSE:while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
VERSE:nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
LABEL:27
VERSE:When he established the heavens, I was there.
VERSE:When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,
LABEL:28
VERSE:when he established the clouds above,
VERSE:when the springs of the deep became strong,
LABEL:29
VERSE:when he gave to the sea its boundary,
VERSE:that the waters should not violate his commandment,
VERSE:when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
LABEL:30
VERSE:then I was the craftsman by his side.
VERSE:I was a delight day by day,
VERSE:always rejoicing before him,
LABEL:31
VERSE:rejoicing in his whole world.
VERSE:My delight was with the sons of men.
LABEL:32
VERSE:“Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,
VERSE:for blessed are those who keep my ways.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Hear instruction, and be wise.
VERSE:Don’t refuse it.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Blessed is the man who hears me,
VERSE:watching daily at my gates,
VERSE:waiting at my door posts.
LABEL:35
VERSE:For whoever finds me finds life,
VERSE:and will obtain favor from Yahweh.
LABEL:36
VERSE:But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.
VERSE:All those who hate me love death.”
