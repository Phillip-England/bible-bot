TITLE:Proverbs 28
LABEL:1
VERSE:The wicked flee when no one pursues;
VERSE:but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
LABEL:2
VERSE:In rebellion, a land has many rulers,
VERSE:but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A needy man who oppresses the poor
VERSE:is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;
VERSE:but those who keep the law contend with them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Evil men don’t understand justice;
VERSE:but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Better is the poor who walks in his integrity
VERSE:than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Whoever keeps the law is a wise son;
VERSE:but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He who increases his wealth by excessive interest
VERSE:gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,
VERSE:even his prayer is an abomination.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,
VERSE:he will fall into his own trap;
VERSE:but the blameless will inherit good.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The rich man is wise in his own eyes;
VERSE:but the poor who has understanding sees through him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;
VERSE:but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,
VERSE:but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Blessed is the man who always fears;
VERSE:but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
LABEL:15
VERSE:As a roaring lion or a charging bear,
VERSE:so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.
LABEL:16
VERSE:A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.
VERSE:One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.
LABEL:17
VERSE:A man who is tormented by blood guilt will be a fugitive until death.
VERSE:No one will support him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe;
VERSE:but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.
LABEL:19
VERSE:One who works his land will have an abundance of food;
VERSE:but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
LABEL:20
VERSE:A faithful man is rich with blessings;
VERSE:but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.
LABEL:21
VERSE:To show partiality is not good,
VERSE:yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.
LABEL:22
VERSE:A stingy man hurries after riches,
VERSE:and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor
VERSE:than one who flatters with the tongue.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,”
VERSE:is a partner with a destroyer.
LABEL:25
VERSE:One who is greedy stirs up strife;
VERSE:but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.
LABEL:26
VERSE:One who trusts in himself is a fool;
VERSE:but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.
LABEL:27
VERSE:One who gives to the poor has no lack;
VERSE:but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.
LABEL:28
VERSE:When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;
VERSE:but when they perish, the righteous thrive.
