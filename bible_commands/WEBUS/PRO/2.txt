TITLE:Proverbs 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, if you will receive my words,
VERSE:and store up my commandments within you,
LABEL:2
VERSE:so as to turn your ear to wisdom,
VERSE:and apply your heart to understanding;
LABEL:3
VERSE:yes, if you call out for discernment,
VERSE:and lift up your voice for understanding;
LABEL:4
VERSE:if you seek her as silver,
VERSE:and search for her as for hidden treasures;
LABEL:5
VERSE:then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,
VERSE:and find the knowledge of God.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For Yahweh gives wisdom.
VERSE:Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.
VERSE:He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
LABEL:8
VERSE:that he may guard the paths of justice,
VERSE:and preserve the way of his saints.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Then you will understand righteousness and justice,
VERSE:equity and every good path.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For wisdom will enter into your heart.
VERSE:Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Discretion will watch over you.
VERSE:Understanding will keep you,
LABEL:12
VERSE:to deliver you from the way of evil,
VERSE:from the men who speak perverse things,
LABEL:13
VERSE:who forsake the paths of uprightness,
VERSE:to walk in the ways of darkness,
LABEL:14
VERSE:who rejoice to do evil,
VERSE:and delight in the perverseness of evil,
LABEL:15
VERSE:who are crooked in their ways,
VERSE:and wayward in their paths,
LABEL:16
VERSE:to deliver you from the strange woman,
VERSE:even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,
LABEL:17
VERSE:who forsakes the friend of her youth,
VERSE:and forgets the covenant of her God;
LABEL:18
VERSE:for her house leads down to death,
VERSE:her paths to the departed spirits.
LABEL:19
VERSE:None who go to her return again,
VERSE:neither do they attain to the paths of life.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Therefore walk in the way of good men,
VERSE:and keep the paths of the righteous.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the upright will dwell in the land.
VERSE:The perfect will remain in it.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But the wicked will be cut off from the land.
VERSE:The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
