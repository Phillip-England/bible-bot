VERSE:My son, don’t forget my teaching,
VERSE:but let your heart keep my commandments,
LABEL:2
VERSE:for they will add to you length of days,
VERSE:years of life, and peace.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you.
VERSE:Bind them around your neck.
VERSE:Write them on the tablet of your heart.
LABEL:4
VERSE:So you will find favor,
VERSE:and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,
VERSE:and don’t lean on your own understanding.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In all your ways acknowledge him,
VERSE:and he will make your paths straight.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Don’t be wise in your own eyes.
VERSE:Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
LABEL:8
VERSE:It will be health to your body,
VERSE:and nourishment to your bones.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Honor Yahweh with your substance,
VERSE:with the first fruits of all your increase;
LABEL:10
VERSE:so your barns will be filled with plenty,
VERSE:and your vats will overflow with new wine.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline,
VERSE:neither be weary of his correction;
LABEL:12
VERSE:for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects,
VERSE:even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Happy is the man who finds wisdom,
VERSE:the man who gets understanding.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For her good profit is better than getting silver,
VERSE:and her return is better than fine gold.
LABEL:15
VERSE:She is more precious than rubies.
VERSE:None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Length of days is in her right hand.
VERSE:In her left hand are riches and honor.

VERSE:By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.
VERSE:By understanding, he established the heavens.
LABEL:20
VERSE:By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,
VERSE:and the skies drop down the dew.
LABEL:21
VERSE:My son, let them not depart from your eyes.
VERSE:Keep sound wisdom and discretion,
LABEL:22
VERSE:so they will be life to your soul,
VERSE:and grace for your neck.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Then you shall walk in your way securely.
VERSE:Your foot won’t stumble.
LABEL:24
VERSE:When you lie down, you will not be afraid.
VERSE:Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,
VERSE:neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;
LABEL:26
VERSE:for Yahweh will be your confidence,
VERSE:and will keep your foot from being taken.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,
VERSE:when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again;
VERSE:tomorrow I will give it to you,”
VERSE:when you have it by you.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Don’t devise evil against your neighbor,
VERSE:since he dwells securely by you.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Don’t strive with a man without cause,
VERSE:if he has done you no harm.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Don’t envy the man of violence.
VERSE:Choose none of his ways.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,
VERSE:but his friendship is with the upright.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked,
VERSE:but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Surely he mocks the mockers,
VERSE:but he gives grace to the humble.
LABEL:35
VERSE:The wise will inherit glory,
VERSE:but shame will be the promotion of fools.
