CHAPTER:30
TITLE:Proverbs 30
LABEL:1
VERSE:The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the revelation:
VERSE:the man says to Ithiel,
VERSE:to Ithiel and Ucal:
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Surely I am the most ignorant man,
VERSE:and don’t have a man’s understanding.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have not learned wisdom,
VERSE:neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?
VERSE:Who has gathered the wind in his fists?
VERSE:Who has bound the waters in his garment?
VERSE:Who has established all the ends of the earth?
VERSE:What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?
LABEL:5
VERSE:“Every word of God is flawless.
VERSE:He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Don’t you add to his words,
VERSE:lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.
LABEL:7
VERSE:“Two things I have asked of you.
VERSE:Don’t deny me before I die.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Remove far from me falsehood and lies.
VERSE:Give me neither poverty nor riches.
VERSE:Feed me with the food that is needful for me,
LABEL:9
VERSE:lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is Yahweh?’
VERSE:or lest I be poor, and steal,
VERSE:and so dishonor the name of my God.
LABEL:10
VERSE:“Don’t slander a servant to his master,
VERSE:lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.
LABEL:11
VERSE:There is a generation that curses their father,
VERSE:and doesn’t bless their mother.
LABEL:12
VERSE:There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,
VERSE:yet are not washed from their filthiness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!
VERSE:Their eyelids are lifted up.
LABEL:14
VERSE:There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,
VERSE:and their jaws like knives,
VERSE:to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from among men.
LABEL:15
VERSE:“The leech has two daughters:
VERSE:‘Give, give.’
VERSE:“There are three things that are never satisfied;
VERSE:four that don’t say, ‘Enough!’:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Sheol,
VERSE:the barren womb,
VERSE:the earth that is not satisfied with water,
VERSE:and the fire that doesn’t say, ‘Enough!’
LABEL:17
VERSE:“The eye that mocks at his father,
VERSE:and scorns obedience to his mother,
VERSE:the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
VERSE:the young eagles shall eat it.
LABEL:18
VERSE:“There are three things which are too amazing for me,
VERSE:four which I don’t understand:
LABEL:19
VERSE:The way of an eagle in the air,
VERSE:the way of a serpent on a rock,
VERSE:the way of a ship in the middle of the sea,
VERSE:and the way of a man with a maiden.
LABEL:20
VERSE:“So is the way of an adulterous woman:
VERSE:She eats and wipes her mouth,
VERSE:and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’
LABEL:21
VERSE:“For three things the earth trembles,
VERSE:and under four, it can’t bear up:
LABEL:22
VERSE:For a servant when he is king,
VERSE:a fool when he is filled with food,
LABEL:23
VERSE:for an unloved woman when she is married,
VERSE:and a servant who is heir to her mistress.
LABEL:24
VERSE:“There are four things which are little on the earth,
VERSE:but they are exceedingly wise:
LABEL:25
VERSE:The ants are not a strong people,
VERSE:yet they provide their food in the summer.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The hyraxes are but a feeble folk,
VERSE:yet make they their houses in the rocks.
LABEL:27
VERSE:The locusts have no king,
VERSE:yet they advance in ranks.
LABEL:28
VERSE:You can catch a lizard with your hands,
VERSE:yet it is in kings’ palaces.
LABEL:29
VERSE:“There are three things which are stately in their march,
VERSE:four which are stately in going:
LABEL:30
VERSE:The lion, which is mightiest among animals,
VERSE:and doesn’t turn away for any;
LABEL:31
VERSE:the greyhound;
VERSE:the male goat;
VERSE:and the king against whom there is no rising up.
LABEL:32
VERSE:“If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,
VERSE:or if you have thought evil,
VERSE:put your hand over your mouth.
LABEL:33
VERSE:For as the churning of milk produces butter,
VERSE:and the wringing of the nose produces blood,
VERSE:so the forcing of wrath produces strife.”
