CHAPTER:27
TITLE:Proverbs 27
LABEL:1
VERSE:Don’t boast about tomorrow;
VERSE:for you don’t know what a day may bring.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let another man praise you,
VERSE:and not your own mouth;
VERSE:a stranger, and not your own lips.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A stone is heavy,
VERSE:and sand is a burden;
VERSE:but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Wrath is cruel,
VERSE:and anger is overwhelming;
VERSE:but who is able to stand before jealousy?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Better is open rebuke
VERSE:than hidden love.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The wounds of a friend are faithful,
VERSE:although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
LABEL:7
VERSE:A full soul loathes a honeycomb;
VERSE:but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.
LABEL:8
VERSE:As a bird that wanders from her nest,
VERSE:so is a man who wanders from his home.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;
VERSE:so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend.
VERSE:Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.
VERSE:A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Be wise, my son,
VERSE:and bring joy to my heart,
VERSE:then I can answer my tormentor.
LABEL:12
VERSE:A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;
VERSE:but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.
VERSE:Hold it for a wayward woman!
LABEL:14
VERSE:He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
VERSE:it will be taken as a curse by him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:A continual dropping on a rainy day
VERSE:and a contentious wife are alike:
LABEL:16
VERSE:restraining her is like restraining the wind,
VERSE:or like grasping oil in his right hand.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Iron sharpens iron;
VERSE:so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.
VERSE:He who looks after his master shall be honored.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Like water reflects a face,
VERSE:so a man’s heart reflects the man.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;
VERSE:and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The crucible is for silver,
VERSE:and the furnace for gold;
VERSE:but man is refined by his praise.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
VERSE:yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Know well the state of your flocks,
VERSE:and pay attention to your herds,
LABEL:24
VERSE:for riches are not forever,
VERSE:nor does the crown endure to all generations.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The hay is removed, and the new growth appears,
VERSE:the grasses of the hills are gathered in.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The lambs are for your clothing,
VERSE:and the goats are the price of a field.
LABEL:27
VERSE:There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,
VERSE:for your family’s food,
VERSE:and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
