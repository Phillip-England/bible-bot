CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Proverbs 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
LABEL:2
VERSE:to know wisdom and instruction;
VERSE:to discern the words of understanding;
LABEL:3
VERSE:to receive instruction in wise dealing,
VERSE:in righteousness, justice, and equity;
LABEL:4
VERSE:to give prudence to the simple,
VERSE:knowledge and discretion to the young man—
LABEL:5
VERSE:that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
VERSE:that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel;
LABEL:6
VERSE:to understand a proverb and parables,
VERSE:the words and riddles of the wise.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge,
VERSE:but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
LABEL:8
VERSE:My son, listen to your father’s instruction,
VERSE:and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching;
LABEL:9
VERSE:for they will be a garland to grace your head,
VERSE:and chains around your neck.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My son, if sinners entice you,
VERSE:don’t consent.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If they say, “Come with us.
VERSE:Let’s lie in wait for blood.
VERSE:Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,
VERSE:and whole, like those who go down into the pit.
LABEL:13
VERSE:We’ll find all valuable wealth.
VERSE:We’ll fill our houses with plunder.
LABEL:14
VERSE:You shall cast your lot among us.
VERSE:We’ll all have one purse”—
LABEL:15
VERSE:my son, don’t walk on the path with them.
VERSE:Keep your foot from their path,
LABEL:16
VERSE:for their feet run to evil.
VERSE:They hurry to shed blood.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;
LABEL:18
VERSE:but these lay in wait for their own blood.
VERSE:They lurk secretly for their own lives.
LABEL:19
VERSE:So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.
VERSE:It takes away the life of its owners.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Wisdom calls aloud in the street.
VERSE:She utters her voice in the public squares.
LABEL:21
VERSE:She calls at the head of noisy places.
VERSE:At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:
LABEL:22
VERSE:“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
VERSE:How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,
VERSE:and fools hate knowledge?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Turn at my reproof.
VERSE:Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
VERSE:I will make known my words to you.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Because I have called, and you have refused;
VERSE:I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
LABEL:25
VERSE:but you have ignored all my counsel,
VERSE:and wanted none of my reproof;
LABEL:26
VERSE:I also will laugh at your disaster.
VERSE:I will mock when calamity overtakes you,
LABEL:27
VERSE:when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
VERSE:when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,
VERSE:when distress and anguish come on you.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.
VERSE:They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,
LABEL:29
VERSE:because they hated knowledge,
VERSE:and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.
LABEL:30
VERSE:They wanted none of my counsel.
VERSE:They despised all my reproof.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,
VERSE:and be filled with their own schemes.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
VERSE:The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
LABEL:33
VERSE:But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,
VERSE:and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”
