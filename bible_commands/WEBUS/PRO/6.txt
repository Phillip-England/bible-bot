CHAPTER:6
TITLE:Proverbs 6
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,
VERSE:if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,
LABEL:2
VERSE:you are trapped by the words of your mouth;
VERSE:you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,
VERSE:since you have come into the hand of your neighbor.
VERSE:Go, humble yourself.
VERSE:Press your plea with your neighbor.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Give no sleep to your eyes,
VERSE:nor slumber to your eyelids.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
VERSE:like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Go to the ant, you sluggard.
VERSE:Consider her ways, and be wise;
LABEL:7
VERSE:which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
LABEL:8
VERSE:provides her bread in the summer,
VERSE:and gathers her food in the harvest.
LABEL:9
VERSE:How long will you sleep, sluggard?
VERSE:When will you arise out of your sleep?
LABEL:10
VERSE:A little sleep, a little slumber,
VERSE:a little folding of the hands to sleep—
LABEL:11
VERSE:so your poverty will come as a robber,
VERSE:and your scarcity as an armed man.
LABEL:12
VERSE:A worthless person, a man of iniquity,
VERSE:is he who walks with a perverse mouth,
LABEL:13
VERSE:who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,
VERSE:who motions with his fingers,
LABEL:14
VERSE:in whose heart is perverseness,
VERSE:who devises evil continually,
VERSE:who always sows discord.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.
VERSE:He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
LABEL:16
VERSE:There are six things which Yahweh hates;
VERSE:yes, seven which are an abomination to him:
LABEL:17
VERSE:arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,
VERSE:hands that shed innocent blood,
LABEL:18
VERSE:a heart that devises wicked schemes,
VERSE:feet that are swift in running to mischief,
LABEL:19
VERSE:a false witness who utters lies,
VERSE:and he who sows discord among brothers.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My son, keep your father’s commandment,
VERSE:and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Bind them continually on your heart.
VERSE:Tie them around your neck.
LABEL:22
VERSE:When you walk, it will lead you.
VERSE:When you sleep, it will watch over you.
VERSE:When you awake, it will talk with you.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For the commandment is a lamp,
VERSE:and the law is light.
VERSE:Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
LABEL:24
VERSE:to keep you from the immoral woman,
VERSE:from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,
VERSE:neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.
VERSE:The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Can a man scoop fire into his lap,
VERSE:and his clothes not be burned?
LABEL:28
VERSE:Or can one walk on hot coals,
VERSE:and his feet not be scorched?
LABEL:29
VERSE:So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife.
VERSE:Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Men don’t despise a thief
VERSE:if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry,
LABEL:31
VERSE:but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.
VERSE:He shall give all the wealth of his house.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.
VERSE:He who does it destroys his own soul.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He will get wounds and dishonor.
VERSE:His reproach will not be wiped away.
LABEL:34
VERSE:For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.
VERSE:He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.
LABEL:35
VERSE:He won’t regard any ransom,
VERSE:neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
