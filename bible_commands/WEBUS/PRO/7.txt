TITLE:Proverbs 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, keep my words.
VERSE:Lay up my commandments within you.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Keep my commandments and live!
VERSE:Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Bind them on your fingers.
VERSE:Write them on the tablet of your heart.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”
VERSE:Call understanding your relative,
LABEL:5
VERSE:that they may keep you from the strange woman,
VERSE:from the foreigner who flatters with her words.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For at the window of my house,
VERSE:I looked out through my lattice.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I saw among the simple ones.
VERSE:I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,
LABEL:8
VERSE:passing through the street near her corner,
VERSE:he went the way to her house,
LABEL:9
VERSE:in the twilight, in the evening of the day,
VERSE:in the middle of the night and in the darkness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,
VERSE:and with crafty intent.
LABEL:11
VERSE:She is loud and defiant.
VERSE:Her feet don’t stay in her house.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,
VERSE:and lurking at every corner.
LABEL:13
VERSE:So she caught him, and kissed him.
VERSE:With an impudent face she said to him:
LABEL:14
VERSE:“Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.
VERSE:Today I have paid my vows.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore I came out to meet you,
VERSE:to diligently seek your face,
VERSE:and I have found you.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,
VERSE:with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning.
VERSE:Let’s solace ourselves with loving.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For my husband isn’t at home.
VERSE:He has gone on a long journey.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He has taken a bag of money with him.
VERSE:He will come home at the full moon.”
LABEL:21
VERSE:With persuasive words, she led him astray.
VERSE:With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He followed her immediately,
VERSE:as an ox goes to the slaughter,
VERSE:as a fool stepping into a noose.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Until an arrow strikes through his liver,
VERSE:as a bird hurries to the snare,
VERSE:and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Now therefore, sons, listen to me.
VERSE:Pay attention to the words of my mouth.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Don’t let your heart turn to her ways.
VERSE:Don’t go astray in her paths,
LABEL:26
VERSE:for she has thrown down many wounded.
VERSE:Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Her house is the way to Sheol,
VERSE:going down to the rooms of death.
