VERSE:The words of King Lemuel—the revelation which his mother taught him:
LABEL:2
VERSE:“Oh, my son!
VERSE:Oh, son of my womb!
VERSE:Oh, son of my vows!
LABEL:3
VERSE:Don’t give your strength to women,
VERSE:nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
LABEL:4
VERSE:It is not for kings, Lemuel,
VERSE:it is not for kings to drink wine,
VERSE:nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’
LABEL:5
VERSE:lest they drink, and forget the law,
VERSE:and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish,
VERSE:and wine to the bitter in soul.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
VERSE:and remember his misery no more.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Open your mouth for the mute,
VERSE:in the cause of all who are left desolate.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Open your mouth, judge righteously,
VERSE:and serve justice to the poor and needy.”

VERSE:“Many women do noble things,
VERSE:but you excel them all.”

VERSE:but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Give her of the fruit of her hands!
VERSE:Let her works praise her in the gates!
