LABEL:1
VERSE:Better is the poor who walks in his integrity
VERSE:than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.

VERSE:A false witness shall not be unpunished.
VERSE:He who pours out lies shall not go free.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Many will entreat the favor of a ruler,
VERSE:and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.

VERSE:All the relatives of the poor shun him;
VERSE:how much more do his friends avoid him!
VERSE:He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.

VERSE:He who keeps understanding shall find good.
LABEL:9
VERSE:A false witness shall not be unpunished.
VERSE:He who utters lies shall perish.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,
VERSE:much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.
VERSE:It is his glory to overlook an offense.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,

LABEL:13
VERSE:A foolish son is the calamity of his father.
VERSE:A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.
LABEL:14
VERSE:House and riches are an inheritance from fathers,
VERSE:but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.
VERSE:The idle soul shall suffer hunger.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,
VERSE:but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh;
VERSE:he will reward him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Discipline your son, for there is hope;
VERSE:don’t be a willing party to his death.
LABEL:19
VERSE:A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,
VERSE:for if you rescue him, you must do it again.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Listen to counsel and receive instruction,
VERSE:that you may be wise in your latter end.
LABEL:21
VERSE:There are many plans in a man’s heart,
VERSE:but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail.
LABEL:22
VERSE:That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.
VERSE:A poor man is better than a liar.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment;
VERSE:he rests and will not be touched by trouble.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
VERSE:he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
VERSE:rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He who robs his father and drives away his mother
VERSE:is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.
LABEL:27
VERSE:If you stop listening to instruction, my son,
VERSE:you will stray from the words of knowledge.
LABEL:28
VERSE:A corrupt witness mocks justice,
VERSE:and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Penalties are prepared for scoffers,
VERSE:and beatings for the backs of fools.
