CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Proverbs 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, pay attention to my wisdom.
VERSE:Turn your ear to my understanding,
LABEL:2
VERSE:that you may maintain discretion,
VERSE:that your lips may preserve knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.
VERSE:Her mouth is smoother than oil,
LABEL:4
VERSE:but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,
VERSE:and as sharp as a two-edged sword.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Her feet go down to death.
VERSE:Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
LABEL:6
VERSE:She gives no thought to the way of life.
VERSE:Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.
VERSE:Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Remove your way far from her.
VERSE:Don’t come near the door of her house,
LABEL:9
VERSE:lest you give your honor to others,
VERSE:and your years to the cruel one;
LABEL:10
VERSE:lest strangers feast on your wealth,
VERSE:and your labors enrich another man’s house.
LABEL:11
VERSE:You will groan at your latter end,
VERSE:when your flesh and your body are consumed,
LABEL:12
VERSE:and say, “How I have hated instruction,
VERSE:and my heart despised reproof.
LABEL:13
VERSE:I haven’t obeyed the voice of my teachers,
VERSE:nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!
LABEL:14
VERSE:I have come to the brink of utter ruin,
VERSE:among the gathered assembly.”
LABEL:15
VERSE:Drink water out of your own cistern,
VERSE:running water out of your own well.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Should your springs overflow in the streets,
VERSE:streams of water in the public squares?
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let them be for yourself alone,
VERSE:not for strangers with you.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Let your spring be blessed.
VERSE:Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
LABEL:19
VERSE:A loving doe and a graceful deer—
VERSE:let her breasts satisfy you at all times.
VERSE:Be captivated always with her love.
LABEL:20
VERSE:For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
VERSE:Why embrace the bosom of another?
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes.
VERSE:He examines all his paths.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.
VERSE:The cords of his sin hold him firmly.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He will die for lack of instruction.
VERSE:In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.
