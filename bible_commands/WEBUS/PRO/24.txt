CHAPTER:24
TITLE:Proverbs 24
LABEL:1
VERSE:Don’t be envious of evil men,
VERSE:neither desire to be with them;
LABEL:2
VERSE:for their hearts plot violence
VERSE:and their lips talk about mischief.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Through wisdom a house is built;
VERSE:by understanding it is established;
LABEL:4
VERSE:by knowledge the rooms are filled
VERSE:with all rare and beautiful treasure.
LABEL:5
VERSE:A wise man has great power.
VERSE:A knowledgeable man increases strength,
LABEL:6
VERSE:for by wise guidance you wage your war,
VERSE:and victory is in many advisors.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wisdom is too high for a fool.
VERSE:He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.
LABEL:8
VERSE:One who plots to do evil
VERSE:will be called a schemer.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The schemes of folly are sin.
VERSE:The mocker is detested by men.
LABEL:10
VERSE:If you falter in the time of trouble,
VERSE:your strength is small.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Rescue those who are being led away to death!
VERSE:Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!
LABEL:12
VERSE:If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,”
VERSE:doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it?
VERSE:He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it?
VERSE:Shall he not render to every man according to his work?
LABEL:13
VERSE:My son, eat honey, for it is good,
VERSE:the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste;
LABEL:14
VERSE:so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul.
VERSE:If you have found it, then there will be a reward:
VERSE:Your hope will not be cut off.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.
VERSE:Don’t destroy his resting place;
LABEL:16
VERSE:for a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again,
VERSE:but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls.
VERSE:Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown,
LABEL:18
VERSE:lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him,
VERSE:and he turn away his wrath from him.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers,
VERSE:neither be envious of the wicked;
LABEL:20
VERSE:for there will be no reward to the evil man.
VERSE:The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.
LABEL:21
VERSE:My son, fear Yahweh and the king.
VERSE:Don’t join those who are rebellious,
LABEL:22
VERSE:for their calamity will rise suddenly.
VERSE:Who knows what destruction may come from them both?
LABEL:23
VERSE:These also are sayings of the wise:
VERSE:To show partiality in judgment is not good.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”
VERSE:peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him—
LABEL:25
VERSE:but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
VERSE:and a rich blessing will come on them.
LABEL:26
VERSE:An honest answer
VERSE:is like a kiss on the lips.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Prepare your work outside,
VERSE:and get your fields ready.
VERSE:Afterwards, build your house.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause.
VERSE:Don’t deceive with your lips.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
VERSE:I will repay the man according to his work.”
LABEL:30
VERSE:I went by the field of the sluggard,
VERSE:by the vineyard of the man void of understanding.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.
VERSE:Its surface was covered with nettles,
VERSE:and its stone wall was broken down.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Then I saw, and considered well.
VERSE:I saw, and received instruction:
LABEL:33
VERSE:a little sleep, a little slumber,
VERSE:a little folding of the hands to sleep,
LABEL:34
VERSE:so your poverty will come as a robber
VERSE:and your want as an armed man.
