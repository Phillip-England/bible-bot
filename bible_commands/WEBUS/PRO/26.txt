VERSE:Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,

VERSE:Like a fluttering sparrow,
VERSE:like a darting swallow,
VERSE:so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A whip is for the horse,
VERSE:a bridle for the donkey,
VERSE:and a rod for the back of fools!
LABEL:4
VERSE:Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,
VERSE:lest you also be like him.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Answer a fool according to his folly,
VERSE:lest he be wise in his own eyes.
LABEL:6
VERSE:One who sends a message by the hand of a fool
VERSE:is cutting off feet and drinking violence.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Like the legs of the lame that hang loose,
VERSE:so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
LABEL:8
VERSE:As one who binds a stone in a sling,
VERSE:so is he who gives honor to a fool.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,
VERSE:so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
LABEL:10
VERSE:As an archer who wounds all,
VERSE:so is he who hires a fool
VERSE:or he who hires those who pass by.
LABEL:11
VERSE:As a dog that returns to his vomit,
VERSE:so is a fool who repeats his folly.

VERSE:Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
VERSE:There is more hope for a fool than for him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
VERSE:A fierce lion roams the streets!”
LABEL:14
VERSE:As the door turns on its hinges,
VERSE:so does the sluggard on his bed.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.
VERSE:He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
VERSE:than seven men who answer with discretion.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Like one who grabs a dog’s ears
VERSE:is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.

VERSE:Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,
LABEL:19
VERSE:is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?”
LABEL:20
VERSE:For lack of wood a fire goes out.
VERSE:Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.
LABEL:21
VERSE:As coals are to hot embers,
VERSE:and wood to fire,
VERSE:so is a contentious man to kindling strife.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
VERSE:they go down into the innermost parts.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Like silver dross on an earthen vessel
VERSE:are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.
LABEL:24
VERSE:A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,
VERSE:but he harbors evil in his heart.
LABEL:25
VERSE:When his speech is charming, don’t believe him,
VERSE:for there are seven abominations in his heart.
LABEL:26
VERSE:His malice may be concealed by deception,
VERSE:but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.
VERSE:Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
LABEL:28
VERSE:A lying tongue hates those it hurts;
VERSE:and a flattering mouth works ruin.
