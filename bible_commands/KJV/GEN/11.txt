VERSE:And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

VERSE:So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
