LABEL:32
VERSE:I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
LABEL:33
VERSE:So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

LABEL:37
VERSE:And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
LABEL:38
VERSE:And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
LABEL:39
VERSE:And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
LABEL:40
VERSE:And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
LABEL:41
VERSE:And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
LABEL:42
VERSE:But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

VERSE:And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.
