BOOK:1CO
CHAPTER:3
TITLE:1 Corinthians 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
LABEL:6
VERSE:I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
LABEL:7
VERSE:So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.
LABEL:10
VERSE:According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
LABEL:13
VERSE:every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
LABEL:14
VERSE:If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
LABEL:17
VERSE:If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
LABEL:20
VERSE:And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;
LABEL:22
VERSE:whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;
LABEL:23
VERSE:and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
