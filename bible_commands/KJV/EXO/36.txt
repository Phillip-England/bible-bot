TITLE:Exodus 36
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
LABEL:3
VERSE:and they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
LABEL:5
VERSE:And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
