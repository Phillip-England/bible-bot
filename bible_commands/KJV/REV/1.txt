LABEL:5

LABEL:11
VERSE:saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
LABEL:12
VERSE:And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
LABEL:13
VERSE:and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
LABEL:14
VERSE:His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
LABEL:15
VERSE:and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
LABEL:18
VERSE:I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
LABEL:20
VERSE:the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
