VERSE:And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

VERSE:And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

LABEL:8
VERSE:And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

VERSE:And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
