VERSE:And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
VERSE:His glory covered the heavens,
VERSE:And the earth was full of his praise.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And his brightness was as the light;
VERSE:He had horns coming out of his hand:
VERSE:And there was the hiding of his power.

VERSE:And burning coals went forth at his feet.

VERSE:The perpetual hills did bow:
VERSE:His ways are everlasting.

VERSE:Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,
VERSE:Through the heap of great waters.

VERSE:My lips quivered at the voice:

VERSE:That I might rest in the day of trouble:
VERSE:When he cometh up unto the people,
VERSE:He will invade them with his troops.

VERSE:I will joy in the God of my salvation.
