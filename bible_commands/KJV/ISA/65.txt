TRANSLATION:KJV
BOOK:ISA
CHAPTER:65
TITLE:Isaiah 65
LABEL:1
VERSE:I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;
LABEL:3
VERSE:a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
LABEL:4
VERSE:which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
LABEL:5
VERSE:which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
LABEL:7
VERSE:your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
LABEL:14
VERSE:behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:
LABEL:16
VERSE:that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
LABEL:19
VERSE:And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
LABEL:20
VERSE:There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
LABEL:21
VERSE:And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
LABEL:23
VERSE:They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
