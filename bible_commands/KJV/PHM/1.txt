BOOK:PHM
CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Philemon 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
LABEL:2
VERSE:and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
LABEL:3
VERSE:grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
LABEL:5
VERSE:hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
LABEL:6
VERSE:that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
LABEL:9
VERSE:yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
LABEL:11
VERSE:which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
LABEL:12
VERSE:whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
LABEL:13
VERSE:whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
LABEL:14
VERSE:but without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
LABEL:16
VERSE:not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
LABEL:17
VERSE:If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
LABEL:18
VERSE:If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
LABEL:19
VERSE:I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
LABEL:23
VERSE:There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
LABEL:24
VERSE:Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
VERSE:Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.
