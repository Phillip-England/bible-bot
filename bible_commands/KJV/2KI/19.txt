VERSE:Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,

LABEL:23
VERSE:By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.

VERSE:Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
LABEL:27
VERSE:But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
LABEL:29
VERSE:And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.
LABEL:30
VERSE:And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
