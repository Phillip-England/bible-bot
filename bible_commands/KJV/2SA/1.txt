TRANSLATION:KJV
BOOK:2SA
CHAPTER:1
TITLE:2 Samuel 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
LABEL:2
VERSE:it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
LABEL:6
VERSE:And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
LABEL:7
VERSE:And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
LABEL:12
VERSE:and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?
LABEL:15
VERSE:And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.
SECTION:David's Lament
LABEL:17
VERSE:And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
LABEL:18
VERSE:(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
LABEL:19
VERSE:The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places:
VERSE:How are the mighty fallen!
LABEL:20
VERSE:Tell it not in Gath,
VERSE:Publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
VERSE:Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
VERSE:Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Ye mountains of Gilboa,
VERSE:Let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings:
VERSE:For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away,
VERSE:The shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
LABEL:22
VERSE:From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
VERSE:The bow of Jonathan turned not back,
VERSE:And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
VERSE:And in their death they were not divided:
VERSE:They were swifter than eagles,
VERSE:They were stronger than lions.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
VERSE:Who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights,
VERSE:Who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
LABEL:25
VERSE:How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
VERSE:O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:
VERSE:Very pleasant hast thou been unto me:
VERSE:Thy love to me was wonderful,
VERSE:Passing the love of women.
LABEL:27
VERSE:How are the mighty fallen,
VERSE:And the weapons of war perished!
