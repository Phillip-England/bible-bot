CHAPTER:8
TITLE:Hebrews 8
SECTION:The Greatness of His Ministry
LABEL:1
VERSE:Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
LABEL:2
VERSE:a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
LABEL:5
VERSE:who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
LABEL:6
VERSE:But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For finding fault with them, he saith,
VERSE:Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
VERSE:When I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
LABEL:9
VERSE:Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
VERSE:In the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
VERSE:Because they continued not in my covenant,
VERSE:And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
VERSE:After those days, saith the Lord;
VERSE:I will put my laws into their mind,
VERSE:And write them in their hearts:
VERSE:And I will be to them a God,
VERSE:And they shall be to me a people:
LABEL:11
VERSE:And they shall not teach every man his neighbour,
VERSE:And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord:
VERSE:For all shall know me,
VERSE:From the least to the greatest.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,
VERSE:And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
LABEL:13
VERSE:In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
