CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Hebrews 3
SECTION:Jesus and Moses
LABEL:1
VERSE:Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
LABEL:2
VERSE:who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
LABEL:6
VERSE:but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith,
VERSE:To day if ye will hear his voice,
LABEL:8
VERSE:Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
VERSE:In the day of temptation in the wilderness:
LABEL:9
VERSE:When your fathers tempted me, proved me,
VERSE:And saw my works forty years.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Wherefore I was grieved with that generation,
VERSE:And said, They do alway err in their heart;
VERSE:And they have not known my ways.
LABEL:11
VERSE:So I sware in my wrath,
VERSE:They shall not enter into my rest.)
LABEL:12
VERSE:Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
LABEL:15
VERSE:while it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
LABEL:18
VERSE:And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
LABEL:19
VERSE:So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
