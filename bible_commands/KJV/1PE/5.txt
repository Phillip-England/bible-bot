CHAPTER:5
TITLE:1 Peter 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
LABEL:2
VERSE:feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
LABEL:3
VERSE:neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
LABEL:7
VERSE:casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
LABEL:9
VERSE:whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
LABEL:11
VERSE:To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
LABEL:12
VERSE:By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.
VERSE:Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
