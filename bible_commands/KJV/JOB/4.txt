TITLE:Job 4
SECTION:Eliphaz Speaks
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:  If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?
VERSE:But who can withhold himself from speaking?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Behold, thou hast instructed many,
VERSE:And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
VERSE:And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest;
VERSE:It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:  Is not this thy fear, thy confidence,
VERSE:Thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?
VERSE:Or where were the righteous cut off?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
VERSE:And sow wickedness, reap the same.
LABEL:9
VERSE:By the blast of God they perish,
VERSE:And by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
VERSE:And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
VERSE:And the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
VERSE:And mine ear received a little thereof.
LABEL:13
VERSE:In thoughts from the visions of the night,
VERSE:When deep sleep falleth on men,
LABEL:14
VERSE:Fear came upon me, and trembling,
VERSE:Which made all my bones to shake.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then a spirit passed before my face;
VERSE:The hair of my flesh stood up:
LABEL:16
VERSE:It stood still,
VERSE:But I could not discern the form thereof:
VERSE:An image was before mine eyes,
VERSE:There was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Shall mortal man be more just than God?
VERSE:Shall a man be more pure than his maker?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Behold, he put no trust in his servants;
VERSE:And his angels he charged with folly:
LABEL:19
VERSE:How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay,
VERSE:Whose foundation is in the dust,
VERSE:Which are crushed before the moth?
LABEL:20
VERSE:They are destroyed from morning to evening:
VERSE:They perish for ever without any regarding it.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Doth not their excellency which is in them go away?
VERSE:They die, even without wisdom.
