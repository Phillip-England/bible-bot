CHAPTER:27
TITLE:Job 27
LABEL:1
VERSE:Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:  As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment;
VERSE:And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
LABEL:3
VERSE:All the while my breath is in me,
VERSE:And the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
LABEL:4
VERSE:My lips shall not speak wickedness,
VERSE:Nor my tongue utter deceit.
LABEL:5
VERSE:God forbid that I should justify you:
VERSE:Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:
VERSE:My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
VERSE:And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
VERSE:When God taketh away his soul?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Will God hear his cry
VERSE:When trouble cometh upon him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Will he delight himself in the Almighty?
VERSE:Will he always call upon God?
LABEL:11
VERSE:I will teach you by the hand of God:
VERSE:That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
VERSE:Why then are ye thus altogether vain?
LABEL:13
VERSE:This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
VERSE:And the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
LABEL:14
VERSE:If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword:
VERSE:And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Those that remain of him shall be buried in death:
VERSE:And his widows shall not weep.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Though he heap up silver as the dust,
VERSE:And prepare raiment as the clay;
LABEL:17
VERSE:He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,
VERSE:And the innocent shall divide the silver.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He buildeth his house as a moth,
VERSE:And as a booth that the keeper maketh.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered:
VERSE:He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Terrors take hold on him as waters,
VERSE:A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth:
VERSE:And as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For God shall cast upon him, and not spare:
VERSE:He would fain flee out of his hand.
LABEL:23
VERSE:  Men shall clap their hands at him,
VERSE:And shall hiss him out of his place.
