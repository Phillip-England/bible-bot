VERSE:Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?
VERSE:Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Canst thou put an hook into his nose?
VERSE:Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Will he make many supplications unto thee?
VERSE:Will he speak soft words unto thee?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Will he make a covenant with thee?
VERSE:Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
VERSE:Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Shall the companions make a banquet of him?
VERSE:Shall they part him among the merchants?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
VERSE:Or his head with fish spears?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Lay thine hand upon him,
VERSE:Remember the battle, do no more.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
VERSE:Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:None is so fierce that dare stir him up:
VERSE:Who then is able to stand before me?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?
VERSE:Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I will not conceal his parts,
VERSE:Nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who can discover the face of his garment?
VERSE:Or who can come to him with his double bridle?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Who can open the doors of his face?
VERSE:His teeth are terrible round about.
LABEL:15
VERSE:  His scales are his pride,
VERSE:Shut up together as with a close seal.
LABEL:16
VERSE:One is so near to another,
VERSE:That no air can come between them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They are joined one to another,
VERSE:They stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
LABEL:18
VERSE:By his neesings a light doth shine,
VERSE:And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
VERSE:And sparks of fire leap out.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,
VERSE:As out of a seething pot or caldron.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His breath kindleth coals,
VERSE:And a flame goeth out of his mouth.
LABEL:22
VERSE:In his neck remaineth strength,
VERSE:And sorrow is turned into joy before him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The flakes of his flesh are joined together:
VERSE:They are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
LABEL:24
VERSE:His heart is as firm as a stone;
VERSE:Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
LABEL:25
VERSE:When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:
VERSE:By reason of breakings they purify themselves.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold:
VERSE:The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He esteemeth iron as straw,
VERSE:And brass as rotten wood.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The arrow cannot make him flee:
VERSE:Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Darts are counted as stubble:
VERSE:He laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Sharp stones are under him:
VERSE:He spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
LABEL:31
VERSE:He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
VERSE:He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He maketh a path to shine after him;
VERSE:One would think the deep to be hoary.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Upon earth there is not his like,
VERSE:Who is made without fear.
LABEL:34
VERSE:He beholdeth all high things:
VERSE:He is a king over all the children of pride.
