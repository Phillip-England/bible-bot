SECTION:Job's Reply
LABEL:1
VERSE:But Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear diligently my speech,
VERSE:And let this be your consolations.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Suffer me that I may speak;
VERSE:And after that I have spoken, mock on.
LABEL:4
VERSE:As for me, is my complaint to man?
VERSE:And if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Mark me, and be astonished,
VERSE:And lay your hand upon your mouth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Even when I remember I am afraid,
VERSE:And trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wherefore do the wicked live,
VERSE:Become old, yea, are mighty in power?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Their seed is established in their sight with them,
VERSE:And their offspring before their eyes.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Their houses are safe from fear,
VERSE:Neither is the rod of God upon them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
VERSE:Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They send forth their little ones like a flock,
VERSE:And their children dance.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They take the timbrel and harp,
VERSE:And rejoice at the sound of the organ.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They spend their days in wealth,
VERSE:And in a moment go down to the grave.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us;
VERSE:For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
LABEL:15
VERSE:What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
VERSE:And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Lo, their good is not in their hand:
VERSE:The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!
VERSE:And how oft cometh their destruction upon them!
VERSE:God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They are as stubble before the wind,
VERSE:And as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
LABEL:19
VERSE:God layeth up his iniquity for his children:
VERSE:He rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
LABEL:20
VERSE:His eyes shall see his destruction,
VERSE:And he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For what pleasure hath he in his house after him,
VERSE:When the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
LABEL:22
VERSE:Shall any teach God knowledge?
VERSE:Seeing he judgeth those that are high.
LABEL:23
VERSE:One dieth in his full strength,
VERSE:Being wholly at ease and quiet.
LABEL:24
VERSE:His breasts are full of milk,
VERSE:And his bones are moistened with marrow.
LABEL:25
VERSE:And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul,
VERSE:And never eateth with pleasure.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They shall lie down alike in the dust,
VERSE:And the worms shall cover them.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Behold, I know your thoughts,
VERSE:And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?
VERSE:And where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
LABEL:29
VERSE:Have ye not asked them that go by the way?
VERSE:And do ye not know their tokens,
LABEL:30
VERSE:That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?
VERSE:They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Who shall declare his way to his face?
VERSE:And who shall repay him what he hath done?
LABEL:32
VERSE:Yet shall he be brought to the grave,
VERSE:And shall remain in the tomb.
LABEL:33
VERSE:The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
VERSE:And every man shall draw after him,
VERSE:As there are innumerable before him.
LABEL:34
VERSE:How then comfort ye me in vain,
VERSE:Seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
