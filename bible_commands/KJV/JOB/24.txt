CHAPTER:24
TITLE:Job 24
LABEL:1
VERSE:Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty,
VERSE:Do they that know him not see his days?
LABEL:2
VERSE:  Some remove the landmarks;
VERSE:They violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
VERSE:They take the widow's ox for a pledge.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They turn the needy out of the way:
VERSE:The poor of the earth hide themselves together.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, as wild asses in the desert,
VERSE:Go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey:
VERSE:The wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
LABEL:6
VERSE:They reap every one his corn in the field:
VERSE:And they gather the vintage of the wicked.
LABEL:7
VERSE:They cause the naked to lodge without clothing,
VERSE:That they have no covering in the cold.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
VERSE:And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They pluck the fatherless from the breast,
VERSE:And take a pledge of the poor.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They cause him to go naked without clothing,
VERSE:And they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
LABEL:11
VERSE:  Which make oil within their walls,
VERSE:And tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Men groan from out of the city,
VERSE:And the soul of the wounded crieth out:
VERSE:Yet God layeth not folly to them.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They are of those that rebel against the light;
VERSE:They know not the ways thereof,
VERSE:Nor abide in the paths thereof.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
VERSE:And in the night is as a thief.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
VERSE:Saying, No eye shall see me:
VERSE:And disguiseth his face.
LABEL:16
VERSE:In the dark they dig through houses,
VERSE:Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime:
VERSE:They know not the light.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death:
VERSE:If one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He is swift as the waters;
VERSE:Their portion is cursed in the earth:
VERSE:He beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
VERSE:So doth the grave those which have sinned.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
VERSE:He shall be no more remembered;
VERSE:And wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not:
VERSE:And doeth not good to the widow.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He draweth also the mighty with his power:
VERSE:He riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
LABEL:23
VERSE:  Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
VERSE:Yet his eyes are upon their ways.
LABEL:24
VERSE:They are exalted for a little while, but are gone
VERSE:And brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other,
VERSE:And cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
LABEL:25
VERSE:And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar,
VERSE:And make my speech nothing worth?
