LABEL:6
VERSE:Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
LABEL:7
VERSE:Gird up thy loins now like a man:
VERSE:I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?
VERSE:Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Hast thou an arm like God?
VERSE:Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;
VERSE:And array thyself with glory and beauty.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:
VERSE:And behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
VERSE:And tread down the wicked in their place.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Hide them in the dust together;
VERSE:And bind their faces in secret.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Then will I also confess unto thee
VERSE:That thine own right hand can save thee.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold now behemoth,
VERSE:Which I made with thee;
VERSE:He eateth grass as an ox.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
VERSE:And his force is in the navel of his belly.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He moveth his tail like a cedar:
VERSE:The sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
LABEL:18
VERSE:His bones are as strong pieces of brass;
VERSE:His bones are like bars of iron.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He is the chief of the ways of God:
VERSE:He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
VERSE:Where all the beasts of the field play.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He lieth under the shady trees,
VERSE:In the covert of the reed, and fens.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The shady trees cover him with their shadow;
VERSE:The willows of the brook compass him about.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not:
VERSE:He trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He taketh it with his eyes:
VERSE:His nose pierceth through snares.
