TITLE:Job 22
SECTION:Eliphaz Speaks
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Can a man be profitable unto God,
VERSE:As he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
LABEL:3
VERSE:  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
VERSE:Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Will he reprove thee for fear of thee?
VERSE:Will he enter with thee into judgment?
LABEL:5
VERSE:  Is not thy wickedness great?
VERSE:And thine iniquities infinite?
LABEL:6
VERSE:For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought,
VERSE:And stripped the naked of their clothing.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
VERSE:And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;
VERSE:And the honourable man dwelt in it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou hast sent widows away empty,
VERSE:And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore snares are round about thee,
VERSE:And sudden fear troubleth thee;
LABEL:11
VERSE:Or darkness, that thou canst not see;
VERSE:And abundance of waters cover thee.
LABEL:12
VERSE:  Is not God in the height of heaven?
VERSE:And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
LABEL:13
VERSE:And thou sayest, How doth God know?
VERSE:Can he judge through the dark cloud?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not;
VERSE:And he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Hast thou marked the old way
VERSE:Which wicked men have trodden?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Which were cut down out of time,
VERSE:Whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
LABEL:17
VERSE:Which said unto God, Depart from us:
VERSE:And what can the Almighty do for them?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Yet he filled their houses with good things:
VERSE:But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The righteous see it, and are glad:
VERSE:And the innocent laugh them to scorn.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Whereas our substance is not cut down,
VERSE:But the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:
VERSE:Thereby good shall come unto thee.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
VERSE:And lay up his words in thine heart.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up,
VERSE:Thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust,
VERSE:And the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence,
VERSE:And thou shalt have plenty of silver.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty,
VERSE:And shalt lift up thy face unto God.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
VERSE:And thou shalt pay thy vows.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee:
VERSE:And the light shall shine upon thy ways.
LABEL:29
VERSE:When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, there is lifting up;
VERSE:And he shall save the humble person.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He shall deliver the island of the innocent:
VERSE:And it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
