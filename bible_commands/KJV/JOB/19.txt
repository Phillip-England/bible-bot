TITLE:Job 19
SECTION:Job's Reply
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:How long will ye vex my soul,
VERSE:And break me in pieces with words?
LABEL:3
VERSE:These ten times have ye reproached me:
VERSE:Ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:And be it indeed that I have erred,
VERSE:Mine error remaineth with myself.
LABEL:5
VERSE:If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
VERSE:And plead against me my reproach:
LABEL:6
VERSE:Know now that God hath overthrown me,
VERSE:And hath compassed me with his net.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
VERSE:I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,
VERSE:And he hath set darkness in my paths.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He hath stripped me of my glory,
VERSE:And taken the crown from my head.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone:
VERSE:And mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
VERSE:And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
LABEL:12
VERSE:His troops come together,
VERSE:And raise up their way against me,
VERSE:And encamp round about my tabernacle.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He hath put my brethren far from me,
VERSE:And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
LABEL:14
VERSE:My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:They that dwell in mine house,
VERSE:And my maids, count me for a stranger:
VERSE:I am an alien in their sight.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I called my servant, and he gave me no answer;
VERSE:I intreated him with my mouth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:My breath is strange to my wife,
VERSE:Though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Yea, young children despised me;
VERSE:I arose, and they spake against me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:All my inward friends abhorred me:
VERSE:And they whom I loved are turned against me.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
VERSE:And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
VERSE:For the hand of God hath touched me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Why do ye persecute me as God,
VERSE:And are not satisfied with my flesh?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Oh that my words were now written!
VERSE:Oh that they were printed in a book!
LABEL:24
VERSE:That they were graven with an iron pen and lead
VERSE:In the rock for ever!
LABEL:25
VERSE:For I know that my redeemer liveth,
VERSE:And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
LABEL:26
VERSE:And though after my skin worms destroy this body,
VERSE:Yet in my flesh shall I see God:
LABEL:27
VERSE:Whom I shall see for myself,
VERSE:And mine eyes shall behold, and not another;
VERSE:Though my reins be consumed within me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:But ye should say, Why persecute we him,
VERSE:Seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
LABEL:29
VERSE:Be ye afraid of the sword:
VERSE:For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword,
VERSE:That ye may know there is a judgment.
