CHAPTER:30
TITLE:Job 30
LABEL:1
VERSE:But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
VERSE:Whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me,
VERSE:In whom old age was perished?
LABEL:3
VERSE:For want and famine they were solitary;
VERSE:Fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who cut up mallows by the bushes,
VERSE:And juniper roots for their meat.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They were driven forth from among men,
VERSE:(They cried after them as after a thief;)
LABEL:6
VERSE:To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys,
VERSE:in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Among the bushes they brayed;
VERSE:Under the nettles they were gathered together.
LABEL:8
VERSE:  They were children of fools, yea, children of base men:
VERSE:They were viler than the earth.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And now am I their song,
VERSE:Yea, I am their byword.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They abhor me, they flee far from me,
VERSE:And spare not to spit in my face.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me,
VERSE:They have also let loose the bridle before me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Upon my right hand rise the youth;
VERSE:They push away my feet,
VERSE:And they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They mar my path,
VERSE:They set forward my calamity,
VERSE:They have no helper.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters:
VERSE:In the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Terrors are turned upon me:
VERSE:They pursue my soul as the wind:
VERSE:And my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And now my soul is poured out upon me;
VERSE:The days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:My bones are pierced in me in the night season:
VERSE:And my sinews take no rest.
LABEL:18
VERSE:By the great force of my disease is my garment changed:
VERSE:It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He hath cast me into the mire,
VERSE:And I am become like dust and ashes.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me:
VERSE:I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Thou art become cruel to me:
VERSE:With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,
VERSE:And dissolvest my substance.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
VERSE:And to the house appointed for all living.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave,
VERSE:Though they cry in his destruction.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
VERSE:Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
LABEL:26
VERSE:When I looked for good, then evil came unto me:
VERSE:And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
LABEL:27
VERSE:My bowels boiled, and rested not:
VERSE:The days of affliction prevented me.
LABEL:28
VERSE:I went mourning without the sun:
VERSE:I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
LABEL:29
VERSE:I am a brother to dragons,
VERSE:And a companion to owls.
LABEL:30
VERSE:My skin is black upon me,
VERSE:And my bones are burned with heat.
LABEL:31
VERSE:My harp also is turned to mourning,
VERSE:And my organ into the voice of them that weep.
