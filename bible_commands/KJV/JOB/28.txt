CHAPTER:28
TITLE:Job 28
LABEL:1
VERSE:Surely there is a vein for the silver,
VERSE:And a place for gold where they fine it.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Iron is taken out of the earth,
VERSE:And brass is molten out of the stone.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He setteth an end to darkness,
VERSE:And searcheth out all perfection:
VERSE:The stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;
VERSE:Even the waters forgotten of the foot:
VERSE:They are dried up, they are gone away from men.
LABEL:5
VERSE:  As for the earth, out of it cometh bread:
VERSE:And under it is turned up as it were fire.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The stones of it are the place of sapphires:
VERSE:And it hath dust of gold.
LABEL:7
VERSE:  There is a path which no fowl knoweth,
VERSE:And which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
LABEL:8
VERSE:The lion's whelps have not trodden it,
VERSE:Nor the fierce lion passed by it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He putteth forth his hand upon the rock;
VERSE:He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He cutteth out rivers among the rocks;
VERSE:And his eye seeth every precious thing.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He bindeth the floods from overflowing;
VERSE:And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But where shall wisdom be found?
VERSE:And where is the place of understanding?
LABEL:13
VERSE:Man knoweth not the price thereof;
VERSE:Neither is it found in the land of the living.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The depth saith, It is not in me:
VERSE:And the sea saith, It is not with me.
LABEL:15
VERSE:It cannot be gotten for gold,
VERSE:Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
LABEL:16
VERSE:It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
VERSE:With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The gold and the crystal cannot equal it:
VERSE:And the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
LABEL:18
VERSE:No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls:
VERSE:For the price of wisdom is above rubies.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
VERSE:Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Whence then cometh wisdom?
VERSE:And where is the place of understanding?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
VERSE:And kept close from the fowls of the air.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Destruction and death say,
VERSE:We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
LABEL:23
VERSE:God understandeth the way thereof,
VERSE:And he knoweth the place thereof.
LABEL:24
VERSE:For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
VERSE:And seeth under the whole heaven;
LABEL:25
VERSE:To make the weight for the winds;
VERSE:And he weigheth the waters by measure.
LABEL:26
VERSE:When he made a decree for the rain,
VERSE:And a way for the lightning of the thunder:
LABEL:27
VERSE:Then did he see it, and declare it;
VERSE:He prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
LABEL:28
VERSE:And unto man he said,
VERSE:Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
VERSE:And to depart from evil is understanding.
