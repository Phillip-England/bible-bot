SECTION:Job's Reply
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:I have heard many such things:
VERSE:Miserable comforters are ye all.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Shall vain words have an end?
VERSE:Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
LABEL:4
VERSE:I also could speak as ye do:
VERSE:If your soul were in my soul's stead,
VERSE:I could heap up words against you,
VERSE:And shake mine head at you.
LABEL:5
VERSE:  But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
VERSE:And the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged:
VERSE:And though I forbear, what am I eased?
LABEL:7
VERSE:But now he hath made me weary:
VERSE:Thou hast made desolate all my company.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me:
VERSE:And my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me:
VERSE:He gnasheth upon me with his teeth;
VERSE:Mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
VERSE:They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully;
VERSE:They have gathered themselves together against me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:God hath delivered me to the ungodly,
VERSE:And turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder:
VERSE:He hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces,
VERSE:And set me up for his mark.
LABEL:13
VERSE:His archers compass me round about,
VERSE:He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
VERSE:He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He breaketh me with breach upon breach,
VERSE:He runneth upon me like a giant.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
VERSE:And defiled my horn in the dust.
LABEL:16
VERSE:My face is foul with weeping,
VERSE:And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Not for any injustice in mine hands:
VERSE:Also my prayer is pure.
LABEL:18
VERSE:O earth, cover not thou my blood,
VERSE:And let my cry have no place.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
VERSE:And my record is on high.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My friends scorn me:
VERSE:but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
LABEL:21
VERSE:O that one might plead for a man with God,
VERSE:As a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
LABEL:22
VERSE:When a few years are come,
VERSE:Then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
