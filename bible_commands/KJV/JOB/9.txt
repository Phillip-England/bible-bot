TITLE:Job 9
SECTION:Job's Reply
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:I know it is so of a truth:
VERSE:But how should man be just with God?
LABEL:3
VERSE:If he will contend with him,
VERSE:He cannot answer him one of a thousand.
LABEL:4
VERSE:  He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
VERSE:Who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Which removeth the mountains, and they know not:
VERSE:Which overturneth them in his anger.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Which shaketh the earth out of her place,
VERSE:And the pillars thereof tremble.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not;
VERSE:And sealeth up the stars.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Which alone spreadeth out the heavens,
VERSE:And treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades,
VERSE:And the chambers of the south.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Which doeth great things past finding out;
VERSE:Yea, and wonders without number.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
VERSE:He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?
VERSE:Who will say unto him, What doest thou?
LABEL:13
VERSE:  If God will not withdraw his anger,
VERSE:The proud helpers do stoop under him.
LABEL:14
VERSE:How much less shall I answer him,
VERSE:And choose out my words to reason with him?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer,
VERSE:But I would make supplication to my judge.
LABEL:16
VERSE:If I had called, and he had answered me;
VERSE:Yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For he breaketh me with a tempest,
VERSE:And multiplieth my wounds without cause.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He will not suffer me to take my breath,
VERSE:But filleth me with bitterness.
LABEL:19
VERSE:If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong:
VERSE:And if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
LABEL:20
VERSE:If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me:
VERSE:If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
LABEL:21
VERSE:  Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul:
VERSE:I would despise my life.
LABEL:22
VERSE:This is one thing, therefore I said it,
VERSE:He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If the scourge slay suddenly,
VERSE:He will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:
VERSE:He covereth the faces of the judges thereof;
VERSE:If not, where, and who is he?
LABEL:25
VERSE:Now my days are swifter than a post:
VERSE:They flee away, they see no good.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They are passed away as the swift ships:
VERSE:As the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
LABEL:27
VERSE:If I say, I will forget my complaint,
VERSE:I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
LABEL:28
VERSE:I am afraid of all my sorrows,
VERSE:I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
LABEL:29
VERSE:  If I be wicked,
VERSE:Why then labour I in vain?
LABEL:30
VERSE:If I wash myself with snow water,
VERSE:And make my hands never so clean;
LABEL:31
VERSE:Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch,
VERSE:And mine own clothes shall abhor me.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,
VERSE:And we should come together in judgment.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Neither is there any daysman betwixt us,
VERSE:That might lay his hand upon us both.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Let him take his rod away from me,
VERSE:And let not his fear terrify me:
LABEL:35
VERSE:  Then would I speak, and not fear him;
VERSE:But it is not so with me.
