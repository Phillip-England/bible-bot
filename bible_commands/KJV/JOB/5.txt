BOOK:JOB
CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Job 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Call now, if there be any that will answer thee;
VERSE:And to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
LABEL:2
VERSE:For wrath killeth the foolish man,
VERSE:And envy slayeth the silly one.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have seen the foolish taking root:
VERSE:But suddenly I cursed his habitation.
LABEL:4
VERSE:His children are far from safety,
VERSE:And they are crushed in the gate,
VERSE:Neither is there any to deliver them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,
VERSE:And taketh it even out of the thorns,
VERSE:And the robber swalloweth up their substance.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,
VERSE:Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
LABEL:7
VERSE:Yet man is born unto trouble,
VERSE:As the sparks fly upward.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I would seek unto God,
VERSE:And unto God would I commit my cause:
LABEL:9
VERSE:Which doeth great things and unsearchable;
VERSE:Marvellous things without number:
LABEL:10
VERSE:Who giveth rain upon the earth,
VERSE:And sendeth waters upon the fields:
LABEL:11
VERSE:To set up on high those that be low;
VERSE:That those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He disappointeth the devices of the crafty,
VERSE:So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:
VERSE:And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They meet with darkness in the daytime,
VERSE:And grope in the noonday as in the night.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth,
VERSE:And from the hand of the mighty.
LABEL:16
VERSE:So the poor hath hope,
VERSE:And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:
VERSE:Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
LABEL:18
VERSE:For he maketh sore, and bindeth up:
VERSE:He woundeth, and his hands make whole.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He shall deliver thee in six troubles:
VERSE:Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In famine he shall redeem thee from death:
VERSE:And in war from the power of the sword.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:
VERSE:Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
LABEL:22
VERSE:At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:
VERSE:Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:
VERSE:And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace;
VERSE:And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
VERSE:And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,
VERSE:Like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;
VERSE:Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
