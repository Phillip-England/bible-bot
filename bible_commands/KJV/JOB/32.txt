CHAPTER:32
TITLE:Job 32
SECTION:Elihu's Intrusion
LABEL:1
VERSE:So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
LABEL:5
VERSE:When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,
VERSE:I am young, and ye are very old;
VERSE:Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I said, Days should speak,
VERSE:And multitude of years should teach wisdom.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But there is a spirit in man:
VERSE:And the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Great men are not always wise:
VERSE:Neither do the aged understand judgment.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore I said, Hearken to me;
VERSE:I also will shew mine opinion.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Behold, I waited for your words;
VERSE:I gave ear to your reasons,
VERSE:Whilst ye searched out what to say.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Yea, I attended unto you,
VERSE:And, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job,
VERSE:Or that answered his words:
LABEL:13
VERSE:Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom:
VERSE:God thrusteth him down, not man.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Now he hath not directed his words against me:
VERSE:Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
LABEL:15
VERSE:They were amazed, they answered no more:
VERSE:They left off speaking.
LABEL:16
VERSE:When I had waited, (for they spake not,
VERSE:But stood still, and answered no more;)
LABEL:17
VERSE:  I said, I will answer also my part,
VERSE:I also will shew mine opinion.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For I am full of matter,
VERSE:The spirit within me constraineth me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent;
VERSE:It is ready to burst like new bottles.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I will speak, that I may be refreshed:
VERSE:I will open my lips and answer.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person,
VERSE:Neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For I know not to give flattering titles;
VERSE:In so doing my Maker would soon take me away.
