VERSE:Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Who is this that darkeneth counsel
VERSE:By words without knowledge?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Gird up now thy loins like a man;
VERSE:For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
VERSE:Declare, if thou hast understanding.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?
VERSE:Or who hath stretched the line upon it?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?
VERSE:Or who laid the corner stone thereof;
LABEL:7
VERSE:When the morning stars sang together,
VERSE:And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Or who shut up the sea with doors,
VERSE:When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
LABEL:9
VERSE:When I made the cloud the garment thereof,
VERSE:And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
LABEL:10
VERSE:And brake up for it my decreed place,
VERSE:And set bars and doors,
LABEL:11
VERSE:And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:
VERSE:And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;
VERSE:And caused the dayspring to know his place;
LABEL:13
VERSE:That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
VERSE:That the wicked might be shaken out of it?
LABEL:14
VERSE:It is turned as clay to the seal;
VERSE:And they stand as a garment.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And from the wicked their light is withholden,
VERSE:And the high arm shall be broken.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
VERSE:Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?

LABEL:18
VERSE:Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?
VERSE:Declare if thou knowest it all.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Where is the way where light dwelleth?
VERSE:And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
LABEL:20
VERSE:That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
VERSE:And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?
VERSE:Or because the number of thy days is great?
LABEL:22
VERSE:Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?
VERSE:Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
LABEL:23
VERSE:Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
VERSE:Against the day of battle and war?
LABEL:24
VERSE:By what way is the light parted,
VERSE:Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
LABEL:25
VERSE:Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
VERSE:Or a way for the lightning of thunder;
LABEL:26
VERSE:To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;
VERSE:On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
LABEL:27
VERSE:To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;
VERSE:And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
LABEL:28
VERSE:Hath the rain a father?
VERSE:Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
LABEL:29
VERSE:Out of whose womb came the ice?
VERSE:And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
LABEL:30
VERSE:The waters are hid as with a stone,
VERSE:And the face of the deep is frozen.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,
VERSE:Or loose the bands of Orion?
LABEL:32
VERSE:Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?
VERSE:Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
LABEL:33
VERSE:Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?
VERSE:Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
LABEL:34
VERSE:Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
VERSE:That abundance of waters may cover thee?
LABEL:35
VERSE:Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go,
VERSE:And say unto thee, Here we are?
LABEL:36
VERSE:Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
VERSE:Or who hath given understanding to the heart?
LABEL:37
VERSE:Who can number the clouds in wisdom?
VERSE:Or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
LABEL:38
VERSE:When the dust groweth into hardness,
VERSE:And the clods cleave fast together?
LABEL:39
VERSE:Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?
VERSE:Or fill the appetite of the young lions,
LABEL:40
VERSE:When they couch in their dens,
VERSE:And abide in the covert to lie in wait?
LABEL:41
VERSE:Who provideth for the raven his food?
VERSE:When his young ones cry unto God,
VERSE:They wander for lack of meat.
