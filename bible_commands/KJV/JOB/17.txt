TITLE:Job 17
LABEL:1
VERSE:My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct,
VERSE:The graves are ready for me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:  Are there not mockers with me?
VERSE:And doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee;
VERSE:Who is he that will strike hands with me?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
VERSE:Therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:He that speaketh flattery to his friends,
VERSE:Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He hath made me also a byword of the people;
VERSE:And aforetime I was as a tabret.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
VERSE:And all my members are as a shadow.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Upright men shall be astonied at this,
VERSE:And the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The righteous also shall hold on his way,
VERSE:And he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But as for you all, do ye return, and come now:
VERSE:For I cannot find one wise man among you.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
VERSE:Even the thoughts of my heart.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They change the night into day:
VERSE:The light is short because of darkness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If I wait, the grave is mine house:
VERSE:I have made my bed in the darkness.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I have said to corruption, Thou art my father:
VERSE:To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And where is now my hope?
VERSE:As for my hope, who shall see it?
LABEL:16
VERSE:They shall go down to the bars of the pit,
VERSE:When our rest together is in the dust.
