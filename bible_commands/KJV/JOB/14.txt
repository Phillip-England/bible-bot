BOOK:JOB
CHAPTER:14
TITLE:Job 14
LABEL:1
VERSE:Man that is born of a woman
VERSE:Is of few days, and full of trouble.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
VERSE:He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one,
VERSE:And bringest me into judgment with thee?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
VERSE:Not one.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee,
VERSE:Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
LABEL:6
VERSE:Turn from him, that he may rest,
VERSE:Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For there is hope of a tree,
VERSE:If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
VERSE:And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
VERSE:And the stock thereof die in the ground;
LABEL:9
VERSE:  Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
VERSE:And bring forth boughs like a plant.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But man dieth, and wasteth away:
VERSE:Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
LABEL:11
VERSE:  As the waters fail from the sea,
VERSE:And the flood decayeth and drieth up:
LABEL:12
VERSE:So man lieth down, and riseth not:
VERSE:Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
VERSE:Nor be raised out of their sleep.
LABEL:13
VERSE:O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave,
VERSE:That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,
VERSE:That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
LABEL:14
VERSE:If a man die, shall he live again?
VERSE:All the days of my appointed time will I wait,
VERSE:Till my change come.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee:
VERSE:Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For now thou numberest my steps:
VERSE:Dost thou not watch over my sin?
LABEL:17
VERSE:My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
VERSE:And thou sewest up mine iniquity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought,
VERSE:And the rock is removed out of his place.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The waters wear the stones:
VERSE:Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth;
VERSE:And thou destroyest the hope of man.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth:
VERSE:Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not;
VERSE:And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But his flesh upon him shall have pain,
VERSE:And his soul within him shall mourn.
