CHAPTER:20
TITLE:Job 20
SECTION:Zophar's Speech
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer,
VERSE:And for this I make haste.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have heard the check of my reproach,
VERSE:And the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Knowest thou not this of old,
VERSE:Since man was placed upon earth,
LABEL:5
VERSE:That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
VERSE:And the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Though his excellency mount up to the heavens,
VERSE:And his head reach unto the clouds;
LABEL:7
VERSE:  Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung:
VERSE:They which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
LABEL:8
VERSE:He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
VERSE:Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The eye also which saw him shall see him no more;
VERSE:Neither shall his place any more behold him.
LABEL:10
VERSE:His children shall seek to please the poor,
VERSE:And his hands shall restore their goods.
LABEL:11
VERSE:His bones are full of the sin of his youth,
VERSE:Which shall lie down with him in the dust.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
VERSE:Though he hide it under his tongue;
LABEL:13
VERSE:  Though he spare it, and forsake it not;
VERSE:But keep it still within his mouth:
LABEL:14
VERSE:  Yet his meat in his bowels is turned,
VERSE:It is the gall of asps within him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:
VERSE:God shall cast them out of his belly.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He shall suck the poison of asps:
VERSE:The viper's tongue shall slay him.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He shall not see the rivers,
VERSE:The floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
LABEL:18
VERSE:That which he laboured for shall he restore,
VERSE:And shall not swallow it down:
VERSE:According to his substance shall the restitution be,
VERSE:and he shall not rejoice therein.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor;
VERSE:Because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
LABEL:20
VERSE:Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly,
VERSE:He shall not save of that which he desired.
LABEL:21
VERSE:There shall none of his meat be left;
VERSE:Therefore shall no man look for his goods.
LABEL:22
VERSE:In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
VERSE:Every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:  When he is about to fill his belly,
VERSE:God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him,
VERSE:And shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He shall flee from the iron weapon,
VERSE:And the bow of steel shall strike him through.
LABEL:25
VERSE:It is drawn, and cometh out of the body;
VERSE:Yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall:
VERSE:Terrors are upon him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:All darkness shall be hid in his secret places:
VERSE:A fire not blown shall consume him;
VERSE:It shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
LABEL:27
VERSE:The heaven shall reveal his iniquity;
VERSE:And the earth shall rise up against him.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The increase of his house shall depart,
VERSE:And his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
LABEL:29
VERSE:This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
VERSE:And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
