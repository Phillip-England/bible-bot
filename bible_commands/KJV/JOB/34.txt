CHAPTER:34
TITLE:Job 34
LABEL:1
VERSE:Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear my words, O ye wise men;
VERSE:And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the ear trieth words,
VERSE:As the mouth tasteth meat.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let us choose to us judgment:
VERSE:Let us know among ourselves what is good.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For Job hath said, I am righteous:
VERSE:And God hath taken away my judgment.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Should I lie against my right?
VERSE:My wound is incurable without transgression.
LABEL:7
VERSE:What man is like Job,
VERSE:Who drinketh up scorning like water?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
VERSE:And walketh with wicked men.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing
VERSE:That he should delight himself with God.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
VERSE:Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness;
VERSE:And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For the work of a man shall he render unto him,
VERSE:And cause every man to find according to his ways.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Yea, surely God will not do wickedly,
VERSE:Neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who hath given him a charge over the earth?
VERSE:Or who hath disposed the whole world?
LABEL:14
VERSE:If he set his heart upon man,
VERSE:If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
LABEL:15
VERSE:All flesh shall perish together,
VERSE:And man shall turn again unto dust.
LABEL:16
VERSE:If now thou hast understanding, hear this:
VERSE:Hearken to the voice of my words.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Shall even he that hateth right govern?
VERSE:And wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
LABEL:18
VERSE:  Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked?
VERSE:and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
LABEL:19
VERSE:  How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes,
VERSE:Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?
VERSE:For they all are the work of his hands.
LABEL:20
VERSE:In a moment shall they die,
VERSE:And the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away:
VERSE:And the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For his eyes are upon the ways of man,
VERSE:And he seeth all his goings.
LABEL:22
VERSE:  There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,
VERSE:Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For he will not lay upon man more than right;
VERSE:That he should enter into judgment with God.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,
VERSE:And set others in their stead.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Therefore he knoweth their works,
VERSE:And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He striketh them as wicked men
VERSE:In the open sight of others;
LABEL:27
VERSE:Because they turned back from him,
VERSE:And would not consider any of his ways:
LABEL:28
VERSE:So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him,
VERSE:And he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
LABEL:29
VERSE:When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?
VERSE:And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?
VERSE:Whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
LABEL:30
VERSE:That the hypocrite reign not,
VERSE:Lest the people be ensnared.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Surely it is meet to be said unto God,
VERSE:I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
LABEL:32
VERSE:  That which I see not teach thou me:
VERSE:If I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
LABEL:33
VERSE:  Should it be according to thy mind?
VERSE:He will recompense it, whether thou refuse,
VERSE:Or whether thou choose; and not I:
VERSE:Therefore speak what thou knowest.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Let men of understanding tell me,
VERSE:And let a wise man hearken unto me.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Job hath spoken without knowledge,
VERSE:And his words were without wisdom.
LABEL:36
VERSE:My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end
VERSE:Because of his answers for wicked men.
LABEL:37
VERSE:For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,
VERSE:He clappeth his hands among us,
VERSE:And multiplieth his words against God.
