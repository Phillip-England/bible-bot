CHAPTER:6
TITLE:Job 6
SECTION:Job's Answer
LABEL:1
VERSE:But Job answered and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Oh that my grief were throughly weighed,
VERSE:And my calamity laid in the balances together!
LABEL:3
VERSE:For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
VERSE:Therefore my words are swallowed up.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
VERSE:The poison whereof drinketh up my spirit:
VERSE:The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
VERSE:Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?
VERSE:Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
LABEL:7
VERSE:The things that my soul refused to touch
VERSE:Are as my sorrowful meat.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Oh that I might have my request;
VERSE:And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
LABEL:9
VERSE:Even that it would please God to destroy me;
VERSE:That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
LABEL:10
VERSE:Then should I yet have comfort;
VERSE:Yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare;
VERSE:For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
LABEL:11
VERSE:What is my strength, that I should hope?
VERSE:And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
LABEL:12
VERSE:  Is my strength the strength of stones?
VERSE:Or is my flesh of brass?
LABEL:13
VERSE:  Is not my help in me?
VERSE:And is wisdom driven quite from me?
LABEL:14
VERSE:To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend;
VERSE:But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
VERSE:And as the stream of brooks they pass away;
LABEL:16
VERSE:Which are blackish by reason of the ice,
VERSE:And wherein the snow is hid:
LABEL:17
VERSE:What time they wax warm, they vanish:
VERSE:When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The paths of their way are turned aside;
VERSE:They go to nothing, and perish.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The troops of Tema looked,
VERSE:The companies of Sheba waited for them.
LABEL:20
VERSE:They were confounded because they had hoped;
VERSE:They came thither, and were ashamed.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For now ye are nothing;
VERSE:Ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Did I say, Bring unto me?
VERSE:Or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand?
VERSE:Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Teach me, and I will hold my tongue:
VERSE:And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
LABEL:25
VERSE:How forcible are right words!
VERSE:But what doth your arguing reprove?
LABEL:26
VERSE:Do ye imagine to reprove words,
VERSE:And the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
LABEL:27
VERSE:Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless,
VERSE:And ye dig a pit for your friend.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Now therefore be content, look upon me;
VERSE:For it is evident unto you if I lie.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity;
VERSE:Yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Is there iniquity in my tongue?
VERSE:Cannot my taste discern perverse things?
