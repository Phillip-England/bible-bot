CHAPTER:15
TITLE:Job 15
SECTION:Eliphaz Speaks
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Should a wise man utter vain knowledge,
VERSE:And fill his belly with the east wind?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Should he reason with unprofitable talk?
VERSE:Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Yea, thou castest off fear,
VERSE:And restrainest prayer before God.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity,
VERSE:And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I:
VERSE:Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
LABEL:7
VERSE:  Art thou the first man that was born?
VERSE:Or wast thou made before the hills?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Hast thou heard the secret of God?
VERSE:And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
LABEL:9
VERSE:What knowest thou, that we know not?
VERSE:What understandest thou, which is not in us?
LABEL:10
VERSE:With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men,
VERSE:Much elder than thy father.
LABEL:11
VERSE:  Are the consolations of God small with thee?
VERSE:Is there any secret thing with thee?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why doth thine heart carry thee away?
VERSE:And what do thy eyes wink at,
LABEL:13
VERSE:That thou turnest thy spirit against God,
VERSE:And lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
LABEL:14
VERSE:What is man, that he should be clean?
VERSE:And he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints;
VERSE:Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
LABEL:16
VERSE:How much more abominable and filthy is man,
VERSE:Which drinketh iniquity like water?
LABEL:17
VERSE:I will shew thee, hear me;
VERSE:And that which I have seen I will declare;
LABEL:18
VERSE:Which wise men have told
VERSE:From their fathers, and have not hid it:
LABEL:19
VERSE:Unto whom alone the earth was given,
VERSE:And no stranger passed among them.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,
VERSE:And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
LABEL:21
VERSE:A dreadful sound is in his ears:
VERSE:In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,
VERSE:And he is waited for of the sword.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?
VERSE:He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid;
VERSE:They shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
LABEL:25
VERSE:For he stretcheth out his hand against God,
VERSE:And strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He runneth upon him, even on his neck,
VERSE:Upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
LABEL:27
VERSE:Because he covereth his face with his fatness,
VERSE:And maketh collops of fat on his flanks.
LABEL:28
VERSE:And he dwelleth in desolate cities,
VERSE:And in houses which no man inhabiteth,
VERSE:Which are ready to become heaps.
LABEL:29
VERSE:He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
VERSE:Neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He shall not depart out of darkness;
VERSE:The flame shall dry up his branches,
VERSE:And by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:
VERSE:For vanity shall be his recompence.
LABEL:32
VERSE:It shall be accomplished before his time,
VERSE:And his branch shall not be green.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
VERSE:And shall cast off his flower as the olive.
LABEL:34
VERSE:For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate,
VERSE:And fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
LABEL:35
VERSE:They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity,
VERSE:And their belly prepareth deceit.
