TRANSLATION:KJV
BOOK:JOB
CHAPTER:10
TITLE:Job 10
LABEL:1
VERSE:My soul is weary of my life;
VERSE:I will leave my complaint upon myself;
VERSE:I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I will say unto God, Do not condemn me;
VERSE:Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:  Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress,
VERSE:That thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands,
VERSE:And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Hast thou eyes of flesh?
VERSE:Or seest thou as man seeth?
LABEL:5
VERSE:  Are thy days as the days of man?
VERSE:Are thy years as man's days,
LABEL:6
VERSE:That thou enquirest after mine iniquity,
VERSE:And searchest after my sin?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Thou knowest that I am not wicked;
VERSE:And there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thine hands have made me and fashioned me
VERSE:Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
VERSE:And wilt thou bring me into dust again?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
VERSE:And curdled me like cheese?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
VERSE:And hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Thou hast granted me life and favour,
VERSE:And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And these things hast thou hid in thine heart:
VERSE:I know that this is with thee.
LABEL:14
VERSE:If I sin, then thou markest me,
VERSE:And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If I be wicked, woe unto me;
VERSE:And if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head.
VERSE:I am full of confusion;
VERSE:Therefore see thou mine affliction;
LABEL:16
VERSE:For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:
VERSE:And again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Thou renewest thy witnesses against me,
VERSE:And increasest thine indignation upon me;
VERSE:Changes and war are against me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?
VERSE:Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
LABEL:19
VERSE:I should have been as though I had not been;
VERSE:I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
LABEL:20
VERSE:  Are not my days few? Cease then,
VERSE:And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
LABEL:21
VERSE:Before I go whence I shall not return,
VERSE:Even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
LABEL:22
VERSE:A land of darkness, as darkness itself;
VERSE:And of the shadow of death, without any order,
VERSE:And where the light is as darkness.
