TITLE:Job 37
LABEL:1
VERSE:At this also my heart trembleth,
VERSE:And is moved out of his place.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hear attentively the noise of his voice,
VERSE:And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He directeth it under the whole heaven,
VERSE:And his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
LABEL:4
VERSE:After it a voice roareth:
VERSE:He thundereth with the voice of his excellency;
VERSE:And he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
LABEL:5
VERSE:God thundereth marvellously with his voice;
VERSE:Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth;
VERSE:Likewise to the small rain,
VERSE:And to the great rain of his strength.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He sealeth up the hand of every man;
VERSE:That all men may know his work.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Then the beasts go into dens,
VERSE:And remain in their places.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Out of the south cometh the whirlwind:
VERSE:And cold out of the north.
LABEL:10
VERSE:By the breath of God frost is given:
VERSE:And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud:
VERSE:He scattereth his bright cloud:
LABEL:12
VERSE:And it is turned round about by his counsels:
VERSE:That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them
VERSE:Upon the face of the world in the earth.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Hearken unto this, O Job:
VERSE:Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Dost thou know when God disposed them,
VERSE:And caused the light of his cloud to shine?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
VERSE:The wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
LABEL:17
VERSE:How thy garments are warm,
VERSE:When he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
LABEL:18
VERSE:Hast thou with him spread out the sky,
VERSE:Which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
LABEL:19
VERSE:Teach us what we shall say unto him;
VERSE:For we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Shall it be told him that I speak?
VERSE:If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
LABEL:21
VERSE:And now men see not the bright light
VERSE:Which is in the clouds:
VERSE:But the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Fair weather cometh out of the north:
VERSE:With God is terrible majesty.
LABEL:23
VERSE:  Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
VERSE:He is excellent in power, and in judgment,
VERSE:And in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Men do therefore fear him:
VERSE:He respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
