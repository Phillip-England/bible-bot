TITLE:Job 39
LABEL:1
VERSE:Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
VERSE:Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?
VERSE:Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
LABEL:3
VERSE:They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones,
VERSE:They cast out their sorrows.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
VERSE:They go forth, and return not unto them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
VERSE:Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Whose house I have made the wilderness,
VERSE:And the barren land his dwellings.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He scorneth the multitude of the city,
VERSE:Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The range of the mountains is his pasture,
VERSE:And he searcheth after every green thing.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee,
VERSE:Or abide by thy crib?
LABEL:10
VERSE:Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?
VERSE:Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?
VERSE:Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,
VERSE:And gather it into thy barn?
LABEL:13
VERSE:  Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?
VERSE:Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,
VERSE:And warmeth them in dust,
LABEL:15
VERSE:And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
VERSE:Or that the wild beast may break them.
LABEL:16
VERSE:She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's:
VERSE:Her labour is in vain without fear;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
VERSE:Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
LABEL:18
VERSE:What time she lifteth up herself on high,
VERSE:She scorneth the horse and his rider.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Hast thou given the horse strength?
VERSE:Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?
VERSE:The glory of his nostrils is terrible.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
VERSE:He goeth on to meet the armed men.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;
VERSE:Neither turneth he back from the sword.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The quiver rattleth against him,
VERSE:The glittering spear and the shield.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:
VERSE:Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha;
VERSE:And he smelleth the battle afar off,
VERSE:The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,
VERSE:And stretch her wings toward the south?
LABEL:27
VERSE:Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,
VERSE:And make her nest on high?
LABEL:28
VERSE:She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,
VERSE:Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
LABEL:29
VERSE:From thence she seeketh the prey,
VERSE:And her eyes behold afar off.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Her young ones also suck up blood:
VERSE:And where the slain are, there is she.
