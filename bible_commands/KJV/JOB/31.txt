BOOK:JOB
CHAPTER:31
TITLE:Job 31
LABEL:1
VERSE:I made a covenant with mine eyes;
VERSE:Why then should I think upon a maid?
LABEL:2
VERSE:For what portion of God is there from above?
VERSE:And what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
LABEL:3
VERSE:  Is not destruction to the wicked?
VERSE:And a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
LABEL:4
VERSE:Doth not he see my ways,
VERSE:And count all my steps?
LABEL:5
VERSE:If I have walked with vanity,
VERSE:Or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
LABEL:6
VERSE:Let me be weighed in an even balance,
VERSE:That God may know mine integrity.
LABEL:7
VERSE:If my step hath turned out of the way,
VERSE:And mine heart walked after mine eyes,
VERSE:And if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
LABEL:8
VERSE:  Then let me sow, and let another eat;
VERSE:Yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
LABEL:9
VERSE:If mine heart have been deceived by a woman,
VERSE:Or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
LABEL:10
VERSE:  Then let my wife grind unto another,
VERSE:And let others bow down upon her.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For this is an heinous crime;
VERSE:Yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction,
VERSE:And would root out all mine increase.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant,
VERSE:When they contended with me;
LABEL:14
VERSE:What then shall I do when God riseth up?
VERSE:And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
LABEL:15
VERSE:Did not he that made me in the womb make him?
VERSE:And did not one fashion us in the womb?
LABEL:16
VERSE:If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
VERSE:Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,
VERSE:And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
LABEL:18
VERSE:(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father,
VERSE:And I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
LABEL:19
VERSE:If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
VERSE:Or any poor without covering;
LABEL:20
VERSE:If his loins have not blessed me,
VERSE:And if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
LABEL:21
VERSE:If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
VERSE:When I saw my help in the gate:
LABEL:22
VERSE:  Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,
VERSE:And mine arm be broken from the bone.
LABEL:23
VERSE:For destruction from God was a terror to me,
VERSE:And by reason of his highness I could not endure.
LABEL:24
VERSE:If I have made gold my hope,
VERSE:Or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
LABEL:25
VERSE:If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,
VERSE:And because mine hand had gotten much;
LABEL:26
VERSE:If I beheld the sun when it shined,
VERSE:Or the moon walking in brightness;
LABEL:27
VERSE:And my heart hath been secretly enticed,
VERSE:Or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
LABEL:28
VERSE:This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge:
VERSE:For I should have denied the God that is above.
LABEL:29
VERSE:If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
VERSE:Or lifted up myself when evil found him:
LABEL:30
VERSE:Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin
VERSE:By wishing a curse to his soul.
LABEL:31
VERSE:If the men of my tabernacle said not,
VERSE:Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
LABEL:32
VERSE:The stranger did not lodge in the street:
VERSE:But I opened my doors to the traveller.
LABEL:33
VERSE:If I covered my transgressions as Adam,
VERSE:By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
LABEL:34
VERSE:Did I fear a great multitude,
VERSE:Or did the contempt of families terrify me,
VERSE:That I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
LABEL:35
VERSE:Oh that one would hear me!
VERSE:Behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me,
VERSE:And that mine adversary had written a book.
LABEL:36
VERSE:Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,
VERSE:And bind it as a crown to me.
LABEL:37
VERSE:I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
VERSE:As a prince would I go near unto him.
LABEL:38
VERSE:If my land cry against me,
VERSE:Or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
LABEL:39
VERSE:If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
VERSE:Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
LABEL:40
VERSE:Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
VERSE:And cockle instead of barley.
VERSE:The words of Job are ended.
