LABEL:1
VERSE:After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And Job spake, and said,
LABEL:3
VERSE:Let the day perish wherein I was born,
VERSE:And the night in which it was said,
VERSE:There is a man child conceived.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let that day be darkness;
VERSE:Let not God regard it from above,
VERSE:Neither let the light shine upon it.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it;
VERSE:Let a cloud dwell upon it;
VERSE:Let the blackness of the day terrify it.
LABEL:6
VERSE:  As for that night, let darkness seize upon it;
VERSE:Let it not be joined unto the days of the year,
VERSE:Let it not come into the number of the months.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Lo, let that night be solitary,
VERSE:Let no joyful voice come therein.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let them curse it that curse the day,
VERSE:Who are ready to raise up their mourning.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark;
VERSE:Let it look for light, but have none;
VERSE:Neither let it see the dawning of the day:
LABEL:10
VERSE:Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb,
VERSE:Nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Why died I not from the womb?
VERSE:Why did I not give up the ghost
VERSE:When I came out of the belly?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why did the knees prevent me?
VERSE:Or why the breasts that I should suck?
LABEL:13
VERSE:For now should I have lain still and been quiet,
VERSE:I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
LABEL:14
VERSE:With kings and counsellors of the earth,
VERSE:Which built desolate places for themselves;
LABEL:15
VERSE:Or with princes that had gold,
VERSE:Who filled their houses with silver:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been;
VERSE:As infants which never saw light.
LABEL:17
VERSE:There the wicked cease from troubling;
VERSE:And there the weary be at rest.
LABEL:18
VERSE:  There the prisoners rest together;
VERSE:They hear not the voice of the oppressor.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The small and great are there;
VERSE:And the servant is free from his master.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
VERSE:And life unto the bitter in soul;
LABEL:21
VERSE:Which long for death, but it cometh not;
VERSE:And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
LABEL:22
VERSE:Which rejoice exceedingly,
VERSE:And are glad, when they can find the grave?
LABEL:23
VERSE:  Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,
VERSE:And whom God hath hedged in?
LABEL:24
VERSE:For my sighing cometh before I eat,
VERSE:And my roarings are poured out like the waters.
LABEL:25
VERSE:For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,
VERSE:And that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
VERSE:Yet trouble came.
