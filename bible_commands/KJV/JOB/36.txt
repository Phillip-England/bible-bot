CHAPTER:36
TITLE:Job 36
LABEL:1
VERSE:Elihu also proceeded, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee
VERSE:That I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
VERSE:And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For truly my words shall not be false:
VERSE:He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:
VERSE:He is mighty in strength and wisdom.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He preserveth not the life of the wicked:
VERSE:But giveth right to the poor.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
VERSE:But with kings are they on the throne;
VERSE:Yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
LABEL:8
VERSE:And if they be bound in fetters,
VERSE:And be holden in cords of affliction;
LABEL:9
VERSE:Then he sheweth them their work,
VERSE:And their transgressions that they have exceeded.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He openeth also their ear to discipline,
VERSE:And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If they obey and serve him,
VERSE:They shall spend their days in prosperity,
VERSE:And their years in pleasures.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword,
VERSE:And they shall die without knowledge.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath:
VERSE:They cry not when he bindeth them.
LABEL:14
VERSE:They die in youth,
VERSE:And their life is among the unclean.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He delivereth the poor in his affliction,
VERSE:And openeth their ears in oppression.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait
VERSE:Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
VERSE:And that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked:
VERSE:Judgment and justice take hold on thee.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke:
VERSE:Then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold,
VERSE:Nor all the forces of strength.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Desire not the night,
VERSE:When people are cut off in their place.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Take heed, regard not iniquity:
VERSE:For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Behold, God exalteth by his power:
VERSE:Who teacheth like him?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Who hath enjoined him his way?
VERSE:Or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Remember that thou magnify his work,
VERSE:Which men behold.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Every man may see it;
VERSE:Man may behold it afar off.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Behold, God is great, and we know him not,
VERSE:Neither can the number of his years be searched out.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For he maketh small the drops of water:
VERSE:They pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
LABEL:28
VERSE:Which the clouds do drop
VERSE:And distil upon man abundantly.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
VERSE:Or the noise of his tabernacle?
LABEL:30
VERSE:Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it,
VERSE:And covereth the bottom of the sea.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For by them judgeth he the people;
VERSE:He giveth meat in abundance.
LABEL:32
VERSE:With clouds he covereth the light;
VERSE:And commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
LABEL:33
VERSE:The noise thereof sheweth concerning it,
VERSE:The cattle also concerning the vapour.
