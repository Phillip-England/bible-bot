CHAPTER:29
TITLE:Job 29
LABEL:1
VERSE:Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Oh that I were as in months past,
VERSE:As in the days when God preserved me;
LABEL:3
VERSE:When his candle shined upon my head,
VERSE:And when by his light I walked through darkness;
LABEL:4
VERSE:As I was in the days of my youth,
VERSE:When the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
LABEL:5
VERSE:When the Almighty was yet with me,
VERSE:When my children were about me;
LABEL:6
VERSE:When I washed my steps with butter,
VERSE:And the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
LABEL:7
VERSE:When I went out to the gate through the city,
VERSE:When I prepared my seat in the street!
LABEL:8
VERSE:The young men saw me, and hid themselves:
VERSE:And the aged arose, and stood up.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The princes refrained talking,
VERSE:And laid their hand on their mouth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The nobles held their peace,
VERSE:And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
VERSE:And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
LABEL:12
VERSE:Because I delivered the poor that cried,
VERSE:And the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:
VERSE:And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
VERSE:My judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
LABEL:15
VERSE:I was eyes to the blind,
VERSE:And feet was I to the lame.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I was a father to the poor:
VERSE:And the cause which I knew not I searched out.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And I brake the jaws of the wicked,
VERSE:And plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Then I said, I shall die in my nest,
VERSE:And I shall multiply my days as the sand.
LABEL:19
VERSE:My root was spread out by the waters,
VERSE:And the dew lay all night upon my branch.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My glory was fresh in me,
VERSE:And my bow was renewed in my hand.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Unto me men gave ear, and waited,
VERSE:And kept silence at my counsel.
LABEL:22
VERSE:After my words they spake not again;
VERSE:And my speech dropped upon them.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And they waited for me as for the rain;
VERSE:And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
LABEL:24
VERSE:  If I laughed on them, they believed it not;
VERSE:And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I chose out their way, and sat chief,
VERSE:And dwelt as a king in the army,
VERSE:As one that comforteth the mourners.
