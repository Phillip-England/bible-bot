TITLE:Job 8
SECTION:Bildad's Speech
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:How long wilt thou speak these things?
VERSE:And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Doth God pervert judgment?
VERSE:Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
LABEL:4
VERSE:If thy children have sinned against him,
VERSE:And he have cast them away for their transgression;
LABEL:5
VERSE:If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes,
VERSE:And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
LABEL:6
VERSE:If thou wert pure and upright;
VERSE:Surely now he would awake for thee,
VERSE:And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Though thy beginning was small,
VERSE:Yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age,
VERSE:And prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
LABEL:9
VERSE:(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
VERSE:Because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
LABEL:10
VERSE:Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,
VERSE:And utter words out of their heart?
LABEL:11
VERSE:Can the rush grow up without mire?
VERSE:Can the flag grow without water?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down,
VERSE:It withereth before any other herb.
LABEL:13
VERSE:So are the paths of all that forget God;
VERSE:And the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
LABEL:14
VERSE:Whose hope shall be cut off,
VERSE:And whose trust shall be a spider's web.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
VERSE:He shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He is green before the sun,
VERSE:And his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
LABEL:17
VERSE:His roots are wrapped about the heap,
VERSE:And seeth the place of stones.
LABEL:18
VERSE:If he destroy him from his place,
VERSE:Then it shall deny him, saying,
VERSE:I have not seen thee.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Behold, this is the joy of his way,
VERSE:And out of the earth shall others grow.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
VERSE:Neither will he help the evil doers:
LABEL:21
VERSE:Till he fill thy mouth with laughing,
VERSE:And thy lips with rejoicing.
LABEL:22
VERSE:They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;
VERSE:And the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
