CHAPTER:33
TITLE:Job 33
LABEL:1
VERSE:Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches,
VERSE:And hearken to all my words.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Behold, now I have opened my mouth,
VERSE:My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
LABEL:3
VERSE:My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart:
VERSE:And my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The Spirit of God hath made me,
VERSE:And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
LABEL:5
VERSE:If thou canst answer me,
VERSE:Set thy words in order before me, stand up.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead:
VERSE:I also am formed out of the clay.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
VERSE:Neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,
VERSE:And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
LABEL:9
VERSE:I am clean without transgression,
VERSE:I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Behold, he findeth occasions against me,
VERSE:He counteth me for his enemy,
LABEL:11
VERSE:He putteth my feet in the stocks,
VERSE:He marketh all my paths.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee,
VERSE:that God is greater than man.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Why dost thou strive against him?
VERSE:For he giveth not account of any of his matters.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For God speaketh once,
VERSE:Yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
LABEL:15
VERSE:In a dream, in a vision of the night,
VERSE:When deep sleep falleth upon men,
VERSE:In slumberings upon the bed;
LABEL:16
VERSE:Then he openeth the ears of men,
VERSE:And sealeth their instruction,
LABEL:17
VERSE:That he may withdraw man from his purpose,
VERSE:And hide pride from man.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
VERSE:And his life from perishing by the sword.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
VERSE:And the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
LABEL:20
VERSE:So that his life abhorreth bread,
VERSE:And his soul dainty meat.
LABEL:21
VERSE:His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
VERSE:And his bones that were not seen stick out.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave,
VERSE:And his life to the destroyers.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If there be a messenger with him,
VERSE:An interpreter, one among a thousand,
VERSE:To shew unto man his uprightness:
LABEL:24
VERSE:Then he is gracious unto him, and saith,
VERSE:Deliver him from going down to the pit:
VERSE:I have found a ransom.
LABEL:25
VERSE:His flesh shall be fresher than a child's:
VERSE:He shall return to the days of his youth:
LABEL:26
VERSE:He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
VERSE:And he shall see his face with joy:
VERSE:For he will render unto man his righteousness.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He looketh upon men, and if any say,
VERSE:I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
VERSE:And it profited me not;
LABEL:28
VERSE:He will deliver his soul from going into the pit,
VERSE:And his life shall see the light.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Lo, all these things worketh God
VERSE:Oftentimes with man,
LABEL:30
VERSE:To bring back his soul from the pit,
VERSE:To be enlightened with the light of the living.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me:
VERSE:Hold thy peace, and I will speak.
LABEL:32
VERSE:If thou hast any thing to say, answer me:
VERSE:Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
LABEL:33
VERSE:If not, hearken unto me:
VERSE:Hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
