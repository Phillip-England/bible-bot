TITLE:Job 18
SECTION:Bildad's Speech
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:How long will it be ere ye make an end of words?
VERSE:Mark, and afterwards we will speak.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
VERSE:And reputed vile in your sight?
LABEL:4
VERSE:He teareth himself in his anger:
VERSE:Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
VERSE:And shall the rock be removed out of his place?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
VERSE:And the spark of his fire shall not shine.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The light shall be dark in his tabernacle,
VERSE:And his candle shall be put out with him.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
VERSE:And his own counsel shall cast him down.
LABEL:8
VERSE:For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
VERSE:And he walketh upon a snare.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The gin shall take him by the heel,
VERSE:And the robber shall prevail against him.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The snare is laid for him in the ground,
VERSE:And a trap for him in the way.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
VERSE:And shall drive him to his feet.
LABEL:12
VERSE:His strength shall be hungerbitten,
VERSE:And destruction shall be ready at his side.
LABEL:13
VERSE:It shall devour the strength of his skin:
VERSE:Even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
LABEL:14
VERSE:His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle,
VERSE:And it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
LABEL:15
VERSE:It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
VERSE:Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:His roots shall be dried up beneath,
VERSE:And above shall his branch be cut off.
LABEL:17
VERSE:His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
VERSE:And he shall have no name in the street.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He shall be driven from light into darkness,
VERSE:And chased out of the world.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people,
VERSE:Nor any remaining in his dwellings.
LABEL:20
VERSE:They that come after him shall be astonied at his day,
VERSE:As they that went before were affrighted.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,
VERSE:And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
