VERSE:No doubt but ye are the people,
VERSE:And wisdom shall die with you.
LABEL:3
VERSE:But I have understanding as well as you;
VERSE:I am not inferior to you:
VERSE:Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
LABEL:4
VERSE:I am as one mocked of his neighbour,
VERSE:Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him:
VERSE:The just upright man is laughed to scorn.
LABEL:5
VERSE:He that is ready to slip with his feet
VERSE:Is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
LABEL:6
VERSE:The tabernacles of robbers prosper,
VERSE:And they that provoke God are secure;
VERSE:Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
VERSE:And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

VERSE:Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee:
VERSE:And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

VERSE:Who knoweth not in all these
VERSE:That the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
LABEL:10
VERSE:In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
VERSE:And the breath of all mankind.

VERSE:And in length of days understanding.
LABEL:13
VERSE:With him is wisdom and strength,
VERSE:He hath counsel and understanding.

VERSE:He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:
VERSE:Also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
LABEL:16

VERSE:The deceived and the deceiver are his.
LABEL:17

VERSE:And maketh the judges fools.

LABEL:22
VERSE:He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
VERSE:And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.

VERSE:He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth,
VERSE:And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
LABEL:25
VERSE:They grope in the dark without light,
VERSE:And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
