CHAPTER:11
TITLE:Job 11
SECTION:Zophar's Speech
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Should not the multitude of words be answered?
VERSE:And should a man full of talk be justified?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Should thy lies make men hold their peace?
VERSE:And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure,
VERSE:And I am clean in thine eyes.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But oh that God would speak,
VERSE:And open his lips against thee;
LABEL:6
VERSE:And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom,
VERSE:That they are double to that which is!
VERSE:Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Canst thou by searching find out God?
VERSE:Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
LABEL:8
VERSE:  It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?
VERSE:Deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
LABEL:9
VERSE:The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
VERSE:And broader than the sea.
LABEL:10
VERSE:If he cut off, and shut up,
VERSE:Or gather together, then who can hinder him?
LABEL:11
VERSE:For he knoweth vain men:
VERSE:He seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
LABEL:12
VERSE:For vain man would be wise,
VERSE:Though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
LABEL:13
VERSE:If thou prepare thine heart,
VERSE:And stretch out thine hands toward him;
LABEL:14
VERSE:If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,
VERSE:And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
VERSE:Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Because thou shalt forget thy misery,
VERSE:And remember it as waters that pass away:
LABEL:17
VERSE:And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday;
VERSE:Thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;
VERSE:Yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
VERSE:Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
LABEL:20
VERSE:But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
VERSE:And they shall not escape,
VERSE:And their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
