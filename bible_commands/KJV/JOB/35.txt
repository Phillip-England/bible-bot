TITLE:Job 35
LABEL:1
VERSE:Elihu spake moreover, and said,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thinkest thou this to be right,
VERSE:That thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
LABEL:3
VERSE:For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee?
VERSE:And, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will answer thee,
VERSE:And thy companions with thee.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Look unto the heavens, and see;
VERSE:And behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
LABEL:6
VERSE:If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him?
VERSE:Or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
LABEL:7
VERSE:If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?
VERSE:Or what receiveth he of thine hand?
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art;
VERSE:And thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
LABEL:9
VERSE:By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry:
VERSE:They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But none saith, Where is God my maker,
VERSE:Who giveth songs in the night;
LABEL:11
VERSE:Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
VERSE:And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
LABEL:12
VERSE:There they cry, but none giveth answer,
VERSE:Because of the pride of evil men.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Surely God will not hear vanity,
VERSE:Neither will the Almighty regard it.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him,
VERSE:Yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
VERSE:Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain;
VERSE:He multiplieth words without knowledge.
