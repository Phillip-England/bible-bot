VERSE:And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:

SECTION:Amos at Beth-el
LABEL:10
VERSE:Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
LABEL:13
VERSE:but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
LABEL:15
VERSE:and the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.
