CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Romans 3
SECTION:They Are All Under Sin
LABEL:1
VERSE:What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
LABEL:2
VERSE:Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
LABEL:4
VERSE:God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written,
VERSE:That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
VERSE:And mightest overcome when thou art judged.
LABEL:5
VERSE:But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
LABEL:6
VERSE:God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
LABEL:7
VERSE:For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
LABEL:8
VERSE:And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
LABEL:9
VERSE:What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
LABEL:10
VERSE:as it is written,
VERSE:There is none righteous, no, not one:
LABEL:11
VERSE:There is none that understandeth,
VERSE:There is none that seeketh after God.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable;
VERSE:There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Their throat is an open sepulchre;
VERSE:With their tongues they have used deceit;
VERSE:The poison of asps is under their lips:
LABEL:14
VERSE:Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
LABEL:15
VERSE:Their feet are swift to shed blood:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Destruction and misery are in their ways:
LABEL:17
VERSE:And the way of peace have they not known:
LABEL:18
VERSE:There is no fear of God before their eyes.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
SECTION:God's Saving Gift
LABEL:21
VERSE:But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
LABEL:22
VERSE:even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
LABEL:23
VERSE:for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
LABEL:24
VERSE:being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
LABEL:25
VERSE:whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
LABEL:26
VERSE:to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
LABEL:30
VERSE:seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
