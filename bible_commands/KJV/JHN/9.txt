CHAPTER:9
TITLE:John 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
LABEL:3
VERSE:Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
LABEL:5
VERSE:As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
LABEL:6
VERSE:When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
LABEL:7
VERSE:and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
LABEL:11
VERSE:He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
LABEL:19
VERSE:And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
LABEL:20
VERSE:His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
LABEL:21
VERSE:but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
LABEL:22
VERSE:These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
LABEL:27
VERSE:He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
LABEL:28
VERSE:Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
LABEL:29
VERSE:We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
LABEL:30
VERSE:The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
LABEL:33
VERSE:If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
LABEL:34
VERSE:They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
LABEL:36
VERSE:He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
LABEL:37
VERSE:And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
LABEL:38
VERSE:And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
LABEL:39
VERSE:And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
LABEL:40
VERSE:And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
LABEL:41
VERSE:Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
