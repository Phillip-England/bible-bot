CHAPTER:7
TITLE:John 7
SECTION:The Feast of Tabernacles
LABEL:1
VERSE:After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
LABEL:3
VERSE:His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Jud√¶a, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For neither did his brethren believe in him.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
LABEL:9
VERSE:When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
LABEL:12
VERSE:And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
LABEL:15
VERSE:And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
LABEL:16
VERSE:Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
LABEL:20
VERSE:The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
LABEL:23
VERSE:If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
LABEL:24
VERSE:Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
LABEL:26
VERSE:But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
LABEL:27
VERSE:Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
LABEL:29
VERSE:But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
LABEL:31
VERSE:And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
LABEL:32
VERSE:The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
LABEL:36
VERSE:What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?
LABEL:37
VERSE:In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
LABEL:38
VERSE:He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
LABEL:39
VERSE:(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
LABEL:40
VERSE:Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
LABEL:42
VERSE:Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
LABEL:43
VERSE:So there was a division among the people because of him.
LABEL:44
VERSE:And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
LABEL:45
VERSE:Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
LABEL:46
VERSE:The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
LABEL:47
VERSE:Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
LABEL:48
VERSE:Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
LABEL:49
VERSE:But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
LABEL:50
VERSE:Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
LABEL:51
VERSE:Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
LABEL:52
VERSE:They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
LABEL:53
VERSE:And every man went unto his own house.
