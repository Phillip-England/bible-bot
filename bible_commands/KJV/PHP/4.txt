VERSE:Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

VERSE:And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
SECTION:Think on These Things
LABEL:8
VERSE:Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
LABEL:10
VERSE:But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
LABEL:13
VERSE:I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
LABEL:19
VERSE:But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
