CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Psalm 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust:
VERSE:Save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
LABEL:2
VERSE:Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces,
VERSE:While there is none to deliver.
LABEL:3
VERSE:O LORD my God, if I have done this;
VERSE:If there be iniquity in my hands;
LABEL:4
VERSE:If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
VERSE:(Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it;
VERSE:Yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies:
VERSE:And awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
LABEL:7
VERSE:So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
VERSE:For their sakes therefore return thou on high.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The LORD shall judge the people: Judge me, O LORD,
VERSE:According to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end;
VERSE:but establish the just:
VERSE:For the righteous God
VERSE:Trieth the hearts and reins.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My defence is of God,
VERSE:Which saveth the upright in heart.
LABEL:11
VERSE:God judgeth the righteous,
VERSE:And God is angry with the wicked every day.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If he turn not, he will whet his sword;
VERSE:He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;
VERSE:He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Behold, he travaileth with iniquity,
VERSE:And hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He made a pit, and digged it,
VERSE:And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
LABEL:16
VERSE:His mischief shall return upon his own head,
VERSE:And his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness:
VERSE:And will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
