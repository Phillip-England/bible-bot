CHAPTER:64
TITLE:Psalm 64
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer:
VERSE:Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked;
VERSE:From the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Who whet their tongue like a sword,
VERSE:And bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:
LABEL:4
VERSE:That they may shoot in secret at the perfect:
VERSE:Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They encourage themselves in an evil matter:
VERSE:They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who shall see them?
LABEL:6
VERSE:They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
VERSE:Both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But God shall shoot at them
VERSE:With an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
LABEL:8
VERSE:So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
VERSE:All that see them shall flee away.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God;
VERSE:For they shall wisely consider of his doing.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;
VERSE:And all the upright in heart shall glory.
