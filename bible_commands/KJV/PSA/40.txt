CHAPTER:40
TITLE:Psalm 40
LABEL:1
VERSE:I waited patiently for the LORD;
VERSE:And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
VERSE:And set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
LABEL:3
VERSE:And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even
VERSE:praise unto our God:
VERSE:Many shall see it, and fear,
VERSE:And shall trust in the LORD.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust,
VERSE:And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Many, O LORD my God,
VERSE:Are thy wonderful works which thou hast done,
VERSE:And thy thoughts which are to us-ward:
VERSE:They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee:
VERSE:If I would declare and speak of them,
VERSE:They are more than can be numbered.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire;
VERSE:Mine ears hast thou opened:
VERSE:Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Then said I, Lo, I come:
VERSE:In the volume of the book it is written of me,
LABEL:8
VERSE:I delight to do thy will, O my God:
VERSE:Yea, thy law is within my heart.
LABEL:9
VERSE:I have preached righteousness in the great congregation:
VERSE:Lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart;
VERSE:I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation:
VERSE:I have not concealed thy lovingkindness,
VERSE:And thy truth from the great congregation.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD:
VERSE:Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For innumerable evils have compassed me about:
VERSE:Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
VERSE:They are more than the hairs of mine head:
VERSE:Therefore my heart faileth me.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me:
VERSE:O LORD, make haste to help me.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Let them be ashamed and confounded together
VERSE:That seek after my soul to destroy it;
VERSE:Let them be driven backward
VERSE:and put to shame that wish me evil.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame
VERSE:That say unto me, Aha, aha.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:
VERSE:Let such as love thy salvation say continually, the LORD be magnified.
LABEL:17
VERSE:But I am poor and needy; Yet the Lord thinketh upon me:
VERSE:Thou art my help and my deliverer; Make no tarrying, O my God.
