TITLE:Psalm 104
LABEL:1
VERSE:Bless the LORD, O my soul.
VERSE:O LORD my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honour and majesty:
LABEL:2
VERSE:Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment:
VERSE:Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters:
VERSE:Who maketh the clouds his chariot: Who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who maketh his angels spirits;
VERSE:His ministers a flaming fire:
LABEL:5
VERSE:  Who laid the foundations of the earth,
VERSE:That it should not be removed for ever.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:
VERSE:The waters stood above the mountains.
LABEL:7
VERSE:At thy rebuke they fled;
VERSE:At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys
VERSE:Unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
VERSE:That they turn not again to cover the earth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He sendeth the springs into the valleys,
VERSE:Which run among the hills.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They give drink to every beast of the field:
VERSE:The wild asses quench their thirst.
LABEL:12
VERSE:By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
VERSE:Which sing among the branches.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He watereth the hills from his chambers:
VERSE:The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
VERSE:And herb for the service of man:
VERSE:That he may bring forth food out of the earth;
LABEL:15
VERSE:And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
VERSE:And oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The trees of the LORD are full of sap;
VERSE:The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Where the birds make their nests:
VERSE:As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;
VERSE:And the rocks for the conies.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He appointed the moon for seasons:
VERSE:The sun knoweth his going down.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou makest darkness, and it is night:
VERSE:Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:The young lions roar after their prey,
VERSE:And seek their meat from God.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together,
VERSE:And lay them down in their dens.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Man goeth forth unto his work
VERSE:And to his labour until the evening.
LABEL:24
VERSE:O LORD, how manifold are thy works!
VERSE:In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches.
LABEL:25
VERSE:  So is this great and wide sea,
VERSE:Wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
LABEL:26
VERSE:There go the ships: There is that leviathan,
VERSE:Whom thou hast made to play therein.
LABEL:27
VERSE:These wait all upon thee;
VERSE:That thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
LABEL:28
VERSE:  That thou givest them they gather:
VERSE:Thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled:
VERSE:Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created:
VERSE:And thou renewest the face of the earth.
LABEL:31
VERSE:The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever:
VERSE:The LORD shall rejoice in his works.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth:
VERSE:He toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
LABEL:33
VERSE:I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live:
VERSE:I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
LABEL:34
VERSE:My meditation of him shall be sweet:
VERSE:I will be glad in the LORD.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.
VERSE:Bless thou the LORD, O my soul.
VERSE:Praise ye the LORD.
