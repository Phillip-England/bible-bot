CHAPTER:55
TITLE:Psalm 55
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear to my prayer, O God;
VERSE:And hide not thyself from my supplication.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Attend unto me, and hear me:
VERSE:I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
LABEL:3
VERSE:Because of the voice of the enemy,
VERSE:Because of the oppression of the wicked:
VERSE:For they cast iniquity upon me,
VERSE:And in wrath they hate me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:My heart is sore pained within me:
VERSE:And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
VERSE:And horror hath overwhelmed me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!
VERSE:For then would I fly away, and be at rest.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Lo, then would I wander far off,
VERSE:And remain in the wilderness. Selah.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I would hasten my escape
VERSE:From the windy storm and tempest.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues:
VERSE:For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
VERSE:Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Wickedness is in the midst thereof:
VERSE:Deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
VERSE:Then I could have born it:
VERSE:Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me;
VERSE:Then I would have hid myself from him:
LABEL:13
VERSE:But it was thou, a man mine equal,
VERSE:My guide, and mine acquaintance.
LABEL:14
VERSE:We took sweet counsel together,
VERSE:And walked unto the house of God in company.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:
VERSE:For wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
LABEL:16
VERSE:As for me, I will call upon God;
VERSE:And the LORD shall save me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
VERSE:And he shall hear my voice.
LABEL:18
VERSE:He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
VERSE:For there were many with me.
LABEL:19
VERSE:God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah.
VERSE:Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him:
VERSE:He hath broken his covenant.
LABEL:21
VERSE:  The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart:
VERSE:His words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee:
VERSE:He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
LABEL:23
VERSE:But thou,
VERSE:O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
VERSE:Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
VERSE:But I will trust in thee.
