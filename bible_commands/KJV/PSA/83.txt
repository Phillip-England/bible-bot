TITLE:Psalm 83
LABEL:1
VERSE:Keep not thou silence, O God:
VERSE:Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult:
VERSE:And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They have taken crafty counsel against thy people,
VERSE:And consulted against thy hidden ones.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
VERSE:That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For they have consulted together with one consent:
VERSE:They are confederate against thee:
LABEL:6
VERSE:The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites;
VERSE:Of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
LABEL:7
VERSE:Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;
VERSE:The Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
LABEL:8
VERSE:Assur also is joined with them:
VERSE:They have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Do unto them as unto the Midianites;
VERSE:As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
LABEL:10
VERSE:  Which perished at Endor:
VERSE:They became as dung for the earth.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb:
VERSE:Yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
LABEL:12
VERSE:Who said, Let us take to ourselves
VERSE:The houses of God in possession.
LABEL:13
VERSE:O my God, make them like a wheel;
VERSE:As the stubble before the wind.
LABEL:14
VERSE:As the fire burneth a wood,
VERSE:And as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
LABEL:15
VERSE:So persecute them with thy tempest,
VERSE:And make them afraid with thy storm.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Fill their faces with shame;
VERSE:That they may seek thy name, O LORD.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let them be confounded and troubled for ever;
VERSE:Yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
LABEL:18
VERSE:That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH,
VERSE:Art the Most High over all the earth.
