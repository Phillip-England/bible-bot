CHAPTER:18
TITLE:Psalm 18
LABEL:1
VERSE:I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The LORD  is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
VERSE:My God, my strength, in whom I will trust;
VERSE:My buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised:
VERSE:So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The sorrows of death compassed me,
VERSE:And the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The sorrows of hell compassed me about:
VERSE:The snares of death prevented me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In my distress I called upon the LORD,
VERSE:And cried unto my God:
VERSE:He heard my voice out of his temple,
VERSE:And my cry came before him, even into his ears.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Then the earth shook and trembled;
VERSE:The foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
VERSE:And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He bowed the heavens also, and came down:
VERSE:And darkness was under his feet.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
VERSE:Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
VERSE:Were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
LABEL:12
VERSE:At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
VERSE:Hail stones and coals of fire.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice;
VERSE:Hail stones and coals of fire.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
VERSE:And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD,
VERSE:At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He sent from above, he took me,
VERSE:He drew me out of many waters.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me:
VERSE:For they were too strong for me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
VERSE:But the LORD was my stay.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He brought me forth also into a large place;
VERSE:He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
VERSE:According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
VERSE:And have not wickedly departed from my God.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For all his judgments were before me,
VERSE:And I did not put away his statutes from me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I was also upright before him,
VERSE:And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
VERSE:According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
LABEL:25
VERSE:With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful;
VERSE:With an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
LABEL:26
VERSE:With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
VERSE:And with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
VERSE:But wilt bring down high looks.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For thou wilt light my candle:
VERSE:The LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
LABEL:29
VERSE:For by thee I have run through a troop;
VERSE:And by my God have I leaped over a wall.
LABEL:30
VERSE:  As for God, his way is perfect:
VERSE:The word of the LORD is tried: He is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For who is God save the LORD?
VERSE:Or who is a rock save our God?
LABEL:32
VERSE:  It is God that girdeth me with strength,
VERSE:And maketh my way perfect.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He maketh my feet like hinds' feet,
VERSE:And setteth me upon my high places.
LABEL:34
VERSE:He teacheth my hands to war,
VERSE:So that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
VERSE:And thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
LABEL:36
VERSE:Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
VERSE:That my feet did not slip.
LABEL:37
VERSE:I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them:
VERSE:Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
LABEL:38
VERSE:I have wounded them that they were not able to rise:
VERSE:They are fallen under my feet.
LABEL:39
VERSE:For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle:
VERSE:Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies;
VERSE:That I might destroy them that hate me.
LABEL:41
VERSE:They cried, but there was none to save them:
VERSE:Even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind:
VERSE:I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;
VERSE:And thou hast made me the head of the heathen:
VERSE:A people whom
VERSE:I have not known shall serve me.
LABEL:44
VERSE:As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me:
VERSE:The strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
LABEL:45
VERSE:The strangers shall fade away,
VERSE:And be afraid out of their close places.
LABEL:46
VERSE:The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock;
VERSE:And let the God of my salvation be exalted.
LABEL:47
VERSE:  It is God that avengeth me,
VERSE:And subdueth the people under me.
LABEL:48
VERSE:He delivereth me from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me:
VERSE:Thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
LABEL:49
VERSE:Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen,
VERSE:And sing praises unto thy name.
LABEL:50
VERSE:Great deliverance giveth he to his king;
VERSE:And sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
