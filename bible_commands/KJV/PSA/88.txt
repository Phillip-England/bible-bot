CHAPTER:88
TITLE:Psalm 88
LABEL:1
VERSE:O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let my prayer come before thee: Incline thine ear unto my cry;
LABEL:3
VERSE:For my soul is full of troubles:
VERSE:And my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I am counted with them that go down into the pit:
VERSE:I am as a man that hath no strength:
LABEL:5
VERSE:Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
VERSE:Whom thou rememberest no more: And they are cut off from thy hand.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,
VERSE:In darkness, in the deeps.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,
VERSE:And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me;
VERSE:Thou hast made me an abomination unto them:
VERSE:I am shut up,
VERSE:And I cannot come forth.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction:
VERSE:LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?
VERSE:Shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?
VERSE:Or thy faithfulness in destruction?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
VERSE:And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
LABEL:13
VERSE:But unto thee have I cried, O LORD;
VERSE:And in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
LABEL:14
VERSE:  LORD, why castest thou off my soul?
VERSE:Why hidest thou thy face from me?
LABEL:15
VERSE:I am afflicted and ready to die
VERSE:From my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Thy fierce wrath goeth over me;
VERSE:Thy terrors have cut me off.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They came round about me daily like water;
VERSE:They compassed me about together.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,
VERSE:And mine acquaintance into darkness.
