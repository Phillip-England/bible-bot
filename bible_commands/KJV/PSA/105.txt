TITLE:Psalm 105
LABEL:1
VERSE:O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name:
VERSE:Make known his deeds among the people.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him:
VERSE:Talk ye of all his wondrous works.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Glory ye in his holy name:
VERSE:Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Seek the LORD, and his strength:
VERSE:Seek his face evermore.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Remember his marvellous works that he hath done;
VERSE:His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
LABEL:6
VERSE:O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
VERSE:Ye children of Jacob his chosen.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He is the LORD our God:
VERSE:His judgments are in all the earth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
VERSE:The word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Which covenant he made with Abraham,
VERSE:And his oath unto Isaac;
LABEL:10
VERSE:And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law,
VERSE:And to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
LABEL:11
VERSE:Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
VERSE:The lot of your inheritance:
LABEL:12
VERSE:When they were but a few men in number;
VERSE:Yea, very few, and strangers in it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:When they went from one nation to another,
VERSE:From one kingdom to another people;
LABEL:14
VERSE:He suffered no man to do them wrong:
VERSE:Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
LABEL:15
VERSE:  Saying, Touch not mine anointed,
VERSE:And do my prophets no harm.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Moreover he called for a famine upon the land:
VERSE:He brake the whole staff of bread.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He sent a man before them,
VERSE:Even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
LABEL:18
VERSE:Whose feet they hurt with fetters:
VERSE:He was laid in iron:
LABEL:19
VERSE:Until the time that his word came:
VERSE:The word of the LORD tried him.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The king sent and loosed him;
VERSE:Even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He made him lord of his house,
VERSE:And ruler of all his substance:
LABEL:22
VERSE:To bind his princes at his pleasure;
VERSE:And teach his senators wisdom.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Israel also came into Egypt;
VERSE:And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And he increased his people greatly;
VERSE:And made them stronger than their enemies.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He turned their heart to hate his people,
VERSE:To deal subtilly with his servants.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He sent Moses his servant;
VERSE:And Aaron whom he had chosen.
LABEL:27
VERSE:They shewed his signs among them,
VERSE:And wonders in the land of Ham.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He sent darkness, and made it dark;
VERSE:And they rebelled not against his word.
LABEL:29
VERSE:He turned their waters into blood,
VERSE:And slew their fish.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Their land brought forth frogs in abundance,
VERSE:In the chambers of their kings.
LABEL:31
VERSE:He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies,
VERSE:And lice in all their coasts.
LABEL:32
VERSE:He gave them hail for rain,
VERSE:And flaming fire in their land.
LABEL:33
VERSE:He smote their vines also and their fig trees;
VERSE:And brake the trees of their coasts.
LABEL:34
VERSE:He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
LABEL:35
VERSE:And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
LABEL:36
VERSE:He smote also all the firstborn in their land,
VERSE:The chief of all their strength.
LABEL:37
VERSE:He brought them forth also with silver and gold:
VERSE:And there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
LABEL:38
VERSE:Egypt was glad when they departed:
VERSE:For the fear of them fell upon them.
LABEL:39
VERSE:He spread a cloud for a covering;
VERSE:And fire to give light in the night.
LABEL:40
VERSE:  The people asked, and he brought quails,
VERSE:And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
LABEL:41
VERSE:He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out;
VERSE:They ran in the dry places like a river.
LABEL:42
VERSE:For he remembered his holy promise,
VERSE:And Abraham his servant.
LABEL:43
VERSE:And he brought forth his people with joy,
VERSE:And his chosen with gladness:
LABEL:44
VERSE:And gave them the lands of the heathen:
VERSE:And they inherited the labour of the people;
LABEL:45
VERSE:That they might observe his statutes,
VERSE:And keep his laws.
VERSE:Praise ye the LORD.
