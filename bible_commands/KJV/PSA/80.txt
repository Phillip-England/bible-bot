TITLE:Psalm 80
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
VERSE:Thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
VERSE:And come and save us.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Turn us again, O God,
VERSE:And cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
LABEL:4
VERSE:O LORD God of hosts,
VERSE:How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thou feedest them with the bread of tears;
VERSE:And givest them tears to drink in great measure.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours:
VERSE:And our enemies laugh among themselves.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Turn us again, O God of hosts,
VERSE:And cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt:
VERSE:Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou preparedst room before it,
VERSE:And didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The hills were covered with the shadow of it,
VERSE:And the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
LABEL:11
VERSE:She sent out her boughs unto the sea,
VERSE:And her branches unto the river.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Why hast thou then broken down her hedges,
VERSE:So that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
LABEL:13
VERSE:The boar out of the wood doth waste it,
VERSE:And the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven,
VERSE:And behold, and visit this vine;
LABEL:15
VERSE:And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted,
VERSE:And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
LABEL:16
VERSE:  It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
VERSE:They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
VERSE:Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
LABEL:18
VERSE:So will not we go back from thee:
VERSE:Quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts,
VERSE:Cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
