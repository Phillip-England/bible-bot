BOOK:PSA
CHAPTER:102
TITLE:Psalm 102
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear my prayer, O LORD,
VERSE:And let my cry come unto thee.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
VERSE:Incline thine ear unto me: In the day when I call answer me speedily.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For my days are consumed like smoke,
VERSE:And my bones are burned as an hearth.
LABEL:4
VERSE:My heart is smitten, and withered like grass;
VERSE:So that I forget to eat my bread.
LABEL:5
VERSE:By reason of the voice of my groaning
VERSE:My bones cleave to my skin.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I am like a pelican of the wilderness:
VERSE:I am like an owl of the desert.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I watch, and am as a sparrow
VERSE:Alone upon the house top.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
VERSE:And they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For I have eaten ashes like bread,
VERSE:And mingled my drink with weeping,
LABEL:10
VERSE:Because of thine indignation and thy wrath:
VERSE:For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My days are like a shadow that declineth;
VERSE:And I am withered like grass.
LABEL:12
VERSE:But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever;
VERSE:And thy remembrance unto all generations.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion:
VERSE:For the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
VERSE:And favour the dust thereof.
LABEL:15
VERSE:So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD,
VERSE:And all the kings of the earth thy glory.
LABEL:16
VERSE:When the LORD shall build up Zion,
VERSE:He shall appear in his glory.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He will regard the prayer of the destitute,
VERSE:And not despise their prayer.
LABEL:18
VERSE:This shall be written for the generation to come:
VERSE:And the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
VERSE:From heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
LABEL:20
VERSE:To hear the groaning of the prisoner;
VERSE:To loose those that are appointed to death;
LABEL:21
VERSE:To declare the name of the LORD in Zion,
VERSE:And his praise in Jerusalem;
LABEL:22
VERSE:When the people are gathered together,
VERSE:And the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He weakened my strength in the way;
VERSE:He shortened my days.
LABEL:24
VERSE:I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
VERSE:Thy years are throughout all generations.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth:
VERSE:And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
LABEL:26
VERSE:They shall perish, but thou shalt endure:
VERSE:Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
VERSE:As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
LABEL:27
VERSE:But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
LABEL:28
VERSE:The children of thy servants shall continue,
VERSE:And their seed shall be established before thee.
