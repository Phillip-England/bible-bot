CHAPTER:35
TITLE:Psalm 35
LABEL:1
VERSE:Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me:
VERSE:Fight against them that fight against me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Take hold of shield and buckler,
VERSE:And stand up for mine help.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me:
VERSE:Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul:
VERSE:Let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Let them be as chaff before the wind:
VERSE:And let the angel of the LORD chase them.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Let their way be dark and slippery:
VERSE:And let the angel of the LORD persecute them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
VERSE:Which without cause they have digged for my soul.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself:
VERSE:Into that very destruction let him fall.
LABEL:9
VERSE:And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD:
VERSE:It shall rejoice in his salvation.
LABEL:10
VERSE:All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
VERSE:Yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
LABEL:11
VERSE:False witnesses did rise up;
VERSE:They laid to my charge things that I knew not.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They rewarded me evil for good
VERSE:To the spoiling of my soul.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting;
VERSE:And my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother:
VERSE:I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together:
VERSE:Yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
LABEL:16
VERSE:With hypocritical mockers in feasts,
VERSE:They gnashed upon me with their teeth.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
VERSE:Rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I will give thee thanks in the great congregation:
VERSE:I will praise thee among much people.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
VERSE:Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
LABEL:20
VERSE:For they speak not peace:
VERSE:But they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me,
VERSE:And said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
LABEL:22
VERSE:  This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence:
VERSE:O Lord, be not far from me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment,
VERSE:Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness;
VERSE:And let them not rejoice over me.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it:
VERSE:Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt:
VERSE:Let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause:
VERSE:Yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
LABEL:28
VERSE:And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness
VERSE:And of thy praise all the day long.
