CHAPTER:89
TITLE:Psalm 89
LABEL:1
VERSE:I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever:
VERSE:With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever:
VERSE:Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I have made a covenant with my chosen,
VERSE:I have sworn unto David my servant,
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy seed will I establish for ever,
VERSE:And build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD:
VERSE:Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For who in the heaven
VERSE:Can be compared unto the LORD?
VERSE:Who among the sons of the mighty
VERSE:Can be likened unto the LORD?
LABEL:7
VERSE:God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,
VERSE:And to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
LABEL:8
VERSE:O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee?
VERSE:Or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou rulest the raging of the sea:
VERSE:When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
VERSE:Thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
VERSE:As for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The north and the south thou hast created them:
VERSE:Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou hast a mighty arm:
VERSE:Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne:
VERSE:Mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:
VERSE:They shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
LABEL:16
VERSE:In thy name shall they rejoice all the day:
VERSE:And in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For thou art the glory of their strength:
VERSE:And in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For the LORD  is our defence;
VERSE:And the Holy One of Israel is our King.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst,
VERSE:I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
LABEL:20
VERSE:I have found David my servant;
VERSE:With my holy oil have I anointed him:
LABEL:21
VERSE:With whom my hand shall be established:
VERSE:Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The enemy shall not exact upon him;
VERSE:Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:And I will beat down his foes before his face,
VERSE:And plague them that hate him.
LABEL:24
VERSE:But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him:
VERSE:And in my name shall his horn be exalted.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I will set his hand also in the sea,
VERSE:And his right hand in the rivers.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father,
VERSE:My God, and the rock of my salvation.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Also I will make him my firstborn,
VERSE:Higher than the kings of the earth.
LABEL:28
VERSE:My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
VERSE:And my covenant shall stand fast with him.
LABEL:29
VERSE:His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
VERSE:And his throne as the days of heaven.
LABEL:30
VERSE:If his children forsake my law,
VERSE:And walk not in my judgments;
LABEL:31
VERSE:If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
LABEL:32
VERSE:Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
VERSE:Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
LABEL:34
VERSE:My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
LABEL:35
VERSE:Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
LABEL:36
VERSE:His seed shall endure for ever,
VERSE:And his throne as the sun before me.
LABEL:37
VERSE:It shall be established for ever as the moon,
VERSE:And as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
LABEL:38
VERSE:But thou hast cast off and abhorred,
VERSE:Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
LABEL:39
VERSE:Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant:
VERSE:Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
LABEL:40
VERSE:Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
VERSE:Thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
LABEL:41
VERSE:All that pass by the way spoil him:
VERSE:He is a reproach to his neighbours.
LABEL:42
VERSE:Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries;
VERSE:Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword,
VERSE:And hast not made him to stand in the battle.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Thou hast made his glory to cease,
VERSE:And cast his throne down to the ground.
LABEL:45
VERSE:The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
VERSE:Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
LABEL:46
VERSE:How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
VERSE:Shall thy wrath burn like fire?
LABEL:47
VERSE:Remember how short my time is:
VERSE:Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
LABEL:48
VERSE:What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?
VERSE:Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
LABEL:49
VERSE:Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses,
VERSE:Which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
LABEL:50
VERSE:Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants;
VERSE:How I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
LABEL:51
VERSE:Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD;
VERSE:Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
LABEL:52
VERSE:Blessed be the LORD for evermore.
VERSE:Amen, and Amen.
