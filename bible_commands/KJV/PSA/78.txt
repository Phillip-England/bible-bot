CHAPTER:78
TITLE:Psalm 78
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear, O my people, to my law:
VERSE:Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I will open my mouth in a parable:
VERSE:I will utter dark sayings of old:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Which we have heard and known,
VERSE:And our fathers have told us.
LABEL:4
VERSE:We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come,
VERSE:The praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel,
VERSE:Which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
LABEL:6
VERSE:That the generation to come might know them,
VERSE:Even the children which should be born;
VERSE:Who should arise
VERSE:And declare them to their children:
LABEL:7
VERSE:That they might set their hope in God,
VERSE:And not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
LABEL:8
VERSE:And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation;
VERSE:A generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
VERSE:Turned back in the day of battle.
LABEL:10
VERSE:They kept not the covenant of God,
VERSE:And refused to walk in his law;
LABEL:11
VERSE:And forgat his works,
VERSE:And his wonders that he had shewed them.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt,
VERSE:In the field of Zoan.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through;
VERSE:And he made the waters to stand as an heap.
LABEL:14
VERSE:In the daytime also he led them with a cloud,
VERSE:And all the night with a light of fire.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He clave the rocks in the wilderness,
VERSE:And gave them drink as out of the great depths.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He brought streams also out of the rock,
VERSE:And caused waters to run down like rivers.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And they sinned yet more against him
VERSE:By provoking the most High in the wilderness.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And they tempted God in their heart
VERSE:By asking meat for their lust.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Yea, they spake against God;
VERSE:They said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed;
VERSE:Can he give bread also? Can he provide flesh for his people?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth:
VERSE:So a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
LABEL:22
VERSE:Because they believed not in God,
VERSE:And trusted not in his salvation:
LABEL:23
VERSE:Though he had commanded the clouds from above,
VERSE:And opened the doors of heaven,
LABEL:24
VERSE:And had rained down manna upon them to eat,
VERSE:And had given them of the corn of heaven.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Man did eat angels' food:
VERSE:He sent them meat to the full.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven:
VERSE:And by his power he brought in the south wind.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He rained flesh also upon them as dust,
VERSE:And feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
LABEL:28
VERSE:And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,
VERSE:Round about their habitations.
LABEL:29
VERSE:So they did eat, and were well filled: For he gave them their own desire;
LABEL:30
VERSE:They were not estranged from their lust.
VERSE:But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
LABEL:31
VERSE:The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
VERSE:And smote down the chosen men of Israel.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For all this they sinned still,
VERSE:And believed not for his wondrous works.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
VERSE:And their years in trouble.
LABEL:34
VERSE:When he slew them, then they sought him:
VERSE:And they returned and enquired early after God.
LABEL:35
VERSE:And they remembered that God was their rock,
VERSE:And the high God their redeemer.
LABEL:36
VERSE:Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth,
VERSE:And they lied unto him with their tongues.
LABEL:37
VERSE:For their heart was not right with him,
VERSE:Neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
LABEL:38
VERSE:But he, being full of compassion,
VERSE:Forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not:
VERSE:Yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
VERSE:And did not stir up all his wrath.
LABEL:39
VERSE:For he remembered that they were but flesh;
VERSE:A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
LABEL:40
VERSE:How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,
VERSE:And grieve him in the desert!
LABEL:41
VERSE:Yea, they turned back and tempted God,
VERSE:And limited the Holy One of Israel.
LABEL:42
VERSE:They remembered not his hand,
VERSE:Nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
LABEL:43
VERSE:How he had wrought his signs in Egypt,
VERSE:And his wonders in the field of Zoan:
LABEL:44
VERSE:And had turned their rivers into blood;
VERSE:And their floods, that they could not drink.
LABEL:45
VERSE:He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
VERSE:And frogs, which destroyed them.
LABEL:46
VERSE:He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller,
VERSE:And their labour unto the locust.
LABEL:47
VERSE:He destroyed their vines with hail,
VERSE:And their sycomore trees with frost.
LABEL:48
VERSE:He gave up their cattle also to the hail,
VERSE:And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
LABEL:49
VERSE:He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble,
VERSE:By sending evil angels among them.
LABEL:50
VERSE:He made a way to his anger; He spared not their soul from death,
VERSE:But gave their life over to the pestilence;
LABEL:51
VERSE:And smote all the firstborn in Egypt;
VERSE:The chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
LABEL:52
VERSE:But made his own people to go forth like sheep,
VERSE:And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
LABEL:53
VERSE:And he led them on safely, so that they feared not:
VERSE:But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
LABEL:54
VERSE:And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
VERSE:Even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
LABEL:55
VERSE:He cast out the heathen also before them,
VERSE:And divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
LABEL:56
VERSE:Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God,
VERSE:And kept not his testimonies:
LABEL:57
VERSE:But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
VERSE:They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
LABEL:58
VERSE:For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
VERSE:And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
LABEL:59
VERSE:When God heard this, he was wroth,
VERSE:And greatly abhorred Israel:
LABEL:60
VERSE:So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
VERSE:The tent which he placed among men;
LABEL:61
VERSE:And delivered his strength into captivity,
VERSE:And his glory into the enemy's hand.
LABEL:62
VERSE:He gave his people over also unto the sword;
VERSE:And was wroth with his inheritance.
LABEL:63
VERSE:The fire consumed their young men;
VERSE:And their maidens were not given to marriage.
LABEL:64
VERSE:Their priests fell by the sword;
VERSE:And their widows made no lamentation.
LABEL:65
VERSE:Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
VERSE:And like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
LABEL:66
VERSE:And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts:
VERSE:He put them to a perpetual reproach.
LABEL:67
VERSE:Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph,
VERSE:And chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
LABEL:68
VERSE:But chose the tribe of Judah,
VERSE:The mount Zion which he loved.
LABEL:69
VERSE:And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,
VERSE:Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
LABEL:70
VERSE:He chose David also his servant,
VERSE:And took him from the sheepfolds:
LABEL:71
VERSE:From following the ewes great with young he brought him
VERSE:To feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
LABEL:72
VERSE:So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;
VERSE:And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
