VERSE:Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry,
VERSE:Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

VERSE:Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
VERSE:Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; Thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing;
VERSE:I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

VERSE:Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips
VERSE:I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

VERSE:I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God:
VERSE:Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee
VERSE:From those that rise up against them.

VERSE:They are inclosed in their own fat:
VERSE:With their mouth they speak proudly.

VERSE:They have now compassed us in our steps:
VERSE:They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;

VERSE:Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:

VERSE:From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,

VERSE:And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
LABEL:15
VERSE:As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness:
VERSE:I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
