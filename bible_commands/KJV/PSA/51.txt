VERSE:Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
VERSE:According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Wash me throughly from mine iniquity,
VERSE:And cleanse me from my sin.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I acknowledge my transgressions:
VERSE:And my sin is ever before me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight:
VERSE:That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;
VERSE:And in sin did my mother conceive me.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts:
VERSE:And in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:
VERSE:Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Make me to hear joy and gladness;
VERSE:That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Hide thy face from my sins,
VERSE:And blot out all mine iniquities.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Create in me a clean heart, O God;
VERSE:And renew a right spirit within me.

VERSE:Cast me not away from thy presence;
VERSE:And take not thy holy spirit from me.

VERSE:And uphold me with thy free spirit.

VERSE:And sinners shall be converted unto thee.

VERSE:Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation:
VERSE:And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
LABEL:15
VERSE:O Lord, open thou my lips;
VERSE:And my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it:
VERSE:Thou delightest not in burnt offering.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:
VERSE:A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
VERSE:Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
VERSE:Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
