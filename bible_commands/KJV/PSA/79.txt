VERSE:O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance;

VERSE:The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven,
VERSE:The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.

VERSE:Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
VERSE:And there was none to bury them.
LABEL:4
VERSE:We are become a reproach to our neighbours,
VERSE:A scorn and derision to them that are round about us.

VERSE:How long, LORD? Wilt thou be angry for ever?
VERSE:Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
LABEL:6
VERSE:Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,

VERSE:And laid waste his dwelling place.

VERSE:Where is their God?

VERSE:Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee;

VERSE:Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
LABEL:13
