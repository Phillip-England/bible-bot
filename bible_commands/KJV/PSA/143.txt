VERSE:Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications:
VERSE:In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
LABEL:2
VERSE:And enter not into judgment with thy servant:
VERSE:For in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

VERSE:For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground;
VERSE:He hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me;
VERSE:My heart within me is desolate.

VERSE:I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works;
VERSE:I muse on the work of thy hands.

VERSE:I stretch forth my hands unto thee:
VERSE:My soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

VERSE:Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth:
VERSE:Hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

VERSE:Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; For in thee do I trust:
VERSE:Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee.

VERSE:Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies:
VERSE:I flee unto thee to hide me.

VERSE:Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake:
VERSE:For thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
LABEL:12
VERSE:And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies,
VERSE:And destroy all them that afflict my soul: For I am thy servant.
