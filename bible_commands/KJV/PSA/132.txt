VERSE:  LORD, remember David,
VERSE:And all his afflictions:
LABEL:2
VERSE:How he sware unto the LORD,
VERSE:And vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;
LABEL:3
VERSE:Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house,
VERSE:Nor go up into my bed;
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
LABEL:5
VERSE:Until I find out a place for the LORD,
VERSE:An habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah:
VERSE:We found it in the fields of the wood.
LABEL:7
VERSE:We will go into his tabernacles:
VERSE:We will worship at his footstool.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Arise, O LORD, into thy rest;
VERSE:Thou, and the ark of thy strength.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
VERSE:And let thy saints shout for joy.

VERSE:For thy servant David's sake
VERSE:Turn not away the face of thine anointed.

VERSE:The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David;
VERSE:He will not turn from it;

VERSE:Will I set upon thy throne.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them,
VERSE:Their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.

VERSE:For the LORD hath chosen Zion;
VERSE:He hath desired it for his habitation.
LABEL:14
VERSE:This is my rest for ever:
VERSE:Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

VERSE:I will abundantly bless her provision:
VERSE:I will satisfy her poor with bread.

VERSE:I will also clothe her priests with salvation:
VERSE:And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

VERSE:There will I make the horn of David to bud:
VERSE:I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

VERSE:His enemies will I clothe with shame:
VERSE:But upon himself shall his crown flourish.
