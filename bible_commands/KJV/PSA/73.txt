CHAPTER:73
TITLE:Psalm 73
LABEL:1
VERSE:Truly God is good to Israel,
VERSE:Even to such as are of a clean heart.
LABEL:2
VERSE:But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
VERSE:My steps had well nigh slipped.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I was envious at the foolish,
VERSE:When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For there are no bands in their death:
VERSE:But their strength is firm.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They are not in trouble as other men;
VERSE:Neither are they plagued like other men.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain;
VERSE:Violence covereth them as a garment.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Their eyes stand out with fatness:
VERSE:They have more than heart could wish.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
VERSE:They speak loftily.
LABEL:9
VERSE:They set their mouth against the heavens,
VERSE:And their tongue walketh through the earth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Therefore his people return hither:
VERSE:And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
LABEL:11
VERSE:And they say, How doth God know?
VERSE:And is there knowledge in the most High?
LABEL:12
VERSE:Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For all the day long have I been plagued,
VERSE:And chastened every morning.
LABEL:15
VERSE:If I say, I will speak thus;
VERSE:Behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
LABEL:16
VERSE:When I thought to know this,
VERSE:It was too painful for me;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Until I went into the sanctuary of God;
VERSE:Then understood I their end.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Surely thou didst set them in slippery places:
VERSE:Thou castedst them down into destruction.
LABEL:19
VERSE:How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!
VERSE:They are utterly consumed with terrors.
LABEL:20
VERSE:As a dream when one awaketh;
VERSE:So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Thus my heart was grieved,
VERSE:And I was pricked in my reins.
LABEL:22
VERSE:So foolish was I, and ignorant:
VERSE:I was as a beast before thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Nevertheless I am continually with thee:
VERSE:Thou hast holden me by my right hand.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
VERSE:And afterward receive me to glory.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Whom have I in heaven but thee?
VERSE:And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
LABEL:26
VERSE:My flesh and my heart faileth:
VERSE:But God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
LABEL:27
VERSE:For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
VERSE:Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
LABEL:28
VERSE:But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD,
VERSE:That I may declare all thy works.
