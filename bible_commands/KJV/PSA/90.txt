CHAPTER:90
TITLE:Psalm 90
LABEL:1
VERSE:  LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place
VERSE:In all generations.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
VERSE:Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thou turnest man to destruction;
VERSE:And sayest, Return, ye children of men.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday
VERSE:When it is past, and as a watch in the night.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
VERSE:In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
VERSE:In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For we are consumed by thine anger,
VERSE:And by thy wrath are we troubled.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
VERSE:Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
VERSE:We spend our years as a tale that is told.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The days of our years are threescore years and ten; And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years,
VERSE:Yet is their strength labour and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
VERSE:Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
LABEL:12
VERSE:So teach us to number our days,
VERSE:That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Return, O LORD, how long?
VERSE:And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
LABEL:14
VERSE:O satisfy us early with thy mercy;
VERSE:That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
VERSE:And the years wherein we have seen evil.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
VERSE:And thy glory unto their children.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us:
VERSE:And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
