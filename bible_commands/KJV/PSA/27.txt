VERSE:When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh,

VERSE:Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
VERSE:Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
LABEL:4
VERSE:One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
VERSE:That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,
VERSE:To behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

VERSE:For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
VERSE:In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And now shall mine head be lifted up,
VERSE:Above mine enemies round about me:
VERSE:Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
VERSE:I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

VERSE:Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice:

LABEL:14
