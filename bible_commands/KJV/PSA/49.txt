CHAPTER:49
TITLE:Psalm 49
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear this, all ye people;
VERSE:Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
LABEL:2
VERSE:Both low and high,
VERSE:Rich and poor, together.
LABEL:3
VERSE:My mouth shall speak of wisdom;
VERSE:And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I will incline mine ear to a parable:
VERSE:I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
VERSE:When the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
LABEL:6
VERSE:They that trust in their wealth,
VERSE:And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
LABEL:7
VERSE:None of them can by any means redeem his brother,
VERSE:Nor give to God a ransom for him:
LABEL:8
VERSE:(For the redemption of their soul is precious,
VERSE:And it ceaseth for ever:)
LABEL:9
VERSE:That he should still live for ever,
VERSE:And not see corruption.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For he seeth that wise men die,
VERSE:Likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,
VERSE:And their dwelling places to all generations;
VERSE:They call their lands after their own names.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not:
VERSE:He is like the beasts that perish.
LABEL:13
VERSE:This their way is their folly:
VERSE:Yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Like sheep they are laid in the grave; Death shall feed on them; And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
VERSE:And their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave:
VERSE:For he shall receive me. Selah.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Be not thou afraid when one is made rich,
VERSE:When the glory of his house is increased;
LABEL:17
VERSE:For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away:
VERSE:His glory shall not descend after him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Though while he lived he blessed his soul,
VERSE:And men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
VERSE:They shall never see light.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Man that is in honour, and understandeth not,
VERSE:Is like the beasts that perish.
