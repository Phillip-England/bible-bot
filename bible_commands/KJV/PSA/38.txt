CHAPTER:38
TITLE:Psalm 38
LABEL:1
VERSE:O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath:
VERSE:Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For thine arrows stick fast in me,
VERSE:And thy hand presseth me sore.
LABEL:3
VERSE:  There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
VERSE:Neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For mine iniquities are gone over mine head:
VERSE:As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
LABEL:5
VERSE:My wounds stink and are corrupt
VERSE:Because of my foolishness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly;
VERSE:I go mourning all the day long.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease:
VERSE:And there is no soundness in my flesh.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I am feeble and sore broken:
VERSE:I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Lord, all my desire is before thee;
VERSE:And my groaning is not hid from thee.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My heart panteth, my strength faileth me:
VERSE:As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore;
VERSE:And my kinsmen stand afar off.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They also that seek after my life lay snares for me:
VERSE:And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
LABEL:13
VERSE:But I, as a deaf man, heard not;
VERSE:And I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thus I was as a man that heareth not,
VERSE:And in whose mouth are no reproofs.
LABEL:15
VERSE:For in thee, O LORD, do I hope:
VERSE:Thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:
VERSE:When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For I am ready to halt,
VERSE:And my sorrow is continually before me.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For I will declare mine iniquity;
VERSE:I will be sorry for my sin.
LABEL:19
VERSE:But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong:
VERSE:And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
LABEL:20
VERSE:They also that render evil for good
VERSE:Are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Forsake me not, O LORD:
VERSE:O my God, be not far from me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Make haste to help me,
VERSE:O Lord my salvation.
