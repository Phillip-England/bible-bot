VERSE:Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
VERSE:Defend me from them that rise up against me.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
VERSE:And save me from bloody men.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul:
VERSE:The mighty are gathered against me; Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They run and prepare themselves without my fault.
VERSE:Awake to help me, and behold.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel,
VERSE:Awake to visit all the heathen: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.
LABEL:6
VERSE:They return at evening:
VERSE:They make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Behold, they belch out with their mouth: Swords are in their lips:
VERSE:For who, say they, doth hear?
LABEL:8
VERSE:But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them;
VERSE:Thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
LABEL:9
VERSE:  Because of his strength will I wait upon thee:
VERSE:For God is my defence.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The God of my mercy shall prevent me:
VERSE:God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Slay them not, lest my people forget:
VERSE:Scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
LABEL:12
VERSE:  For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride:
VERSE:And for cursing and lying which they speak.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be:
VERSE:And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
LABEL:14
VERSE:And at evening let them return;
VERSE:And let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let them wander up and down for meat,
VERSE:And grudge if they be not satisfied.
LABEL:16
VERSE:But I will sing of thy power; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning:
VERSE:For thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing:
VERSE:For God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
