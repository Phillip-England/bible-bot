BOOK:PSA
CHAPTER:109
TITLE:Psalm 109
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
LABEL:2
VERSE:For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me:
VERSE:They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
LABEL:3
VERSE:They compassed me about also with words of hatred; And fought against me without a cause.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For my love they are my adversaries:
VERSE:But I give myself unto prayer.
LABEL:5
VERSE:And they have rewarded me evil for good,
VERSE:And hatred for my love.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Set thou a wicked man over him:
VERSE:And let Satan stand at his right hand.
LABEL:7
VERSE:When he shall be judged, let him be condemned:
VERSE:And let his prayer become sin.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let his days be few;
VERSE:And let another take his office.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Let his children be fatherless,
VERSE:And his wife a widow.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg:
VERSE:Let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
VERSE:And let the strangers spoil his labour.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let there be none to extend mercy unto him:
VERSE:Neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Let his posterity be cut off;
VERSE:And in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
VERSE:And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Let them be before the LORD continually,
VERSE:That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Because that he remembered not to shew mercy,
VERSE:But persecuted the poor and needy man, That he might even slay the broken in heart.
LABEL:17
VERSE:As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him:
VERSE:As he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
VERSE:So let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him,
VERSE:And for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
LABEL:20
VERSE:  Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD,
VERSE:And of them that speak evil against my soul.
LABEL:21
VERSE:But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
VERSE:Because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For I am poor and needy,
VERSE:And my heart is wounded within me.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
VERSE:I am tossed up and down as the locust.
LABEL:24
VERSE:My knees are weak through fasting;
VERSE:And my flesh faileth of fatness.
LABEL:25
VERSE:I became also a reproach unto them:
VERSE:When they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Help me, O LORD my God:
VERSE:O save me according to thy mercy:
LABEL:27
VERSE:That they may know that this is thy hand;
VERSE:That thou, LORD, hast done it.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Let them curse, but bless thou:
VERSE:When they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame,
VERSE:And let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth;
VERSE:Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor,
VERSE:To save him from those that condemn his soul.
