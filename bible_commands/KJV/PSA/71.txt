VERSE:For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD:
VERSE:Thou art my trust from my youth.

LABEL:7
VERSE:I am as a wonder unto many;
VERSE:But thou art my strong refuge.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Let my mouth be filled with thy praise
VERSE:And with thy honour all the day.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Cast me not off in the time of old age;
VERSE:Forsake me not when my strength faileth.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For mine enemies speak against me;
VERSE:And they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
LABEL:11
VERSE:saying,
VERSE:God hath forsaken him: Persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:O God, be not far from me:
VERSE:O my God, make haste for my help.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
VERSE:Let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But I will hope continually,
VERSE:And will yet praise thee more and more.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day;
VERSE:For I know not the numbers thereof.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD:
VERSE:I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
LABEL:17
VERSE:O God, thou hast taught me from my youth:
VERSE:And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
VERSE:Until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high,
VERSE:Who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

VERSE:  Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again,
VERSE:And shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Thou shalt increase my greatness,
VERSE:And comfort me on every side.
LABEL:22
VERSE:I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God:

LABEL:23
VERSE:My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee;
VERSE:And my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
LABEL:24
VERSE:My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
VERSE:For they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
