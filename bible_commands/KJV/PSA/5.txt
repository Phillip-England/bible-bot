VERSE:Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God:
VERSE:For unto thee will I pray.
LABEL:3
VERSE:My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD;
VERSE:In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
LABEL:4
VERSE:For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
VERSE:Neither shall evil dwell with thee.

VERSE:The foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
VERSE:Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing:
VERSE:The LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

VERSE:But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy:
VERSE:And in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
VERSE:Make thy way straight before my face.

VERSE:For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
VERSE:Their inward part is very wickedness;
VERSE:Their throat is an open sepulchre;
VERSE:They flatter with their tongue.

VERSE:Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
VERSE:Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
LABEL:11
VERSE:But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice:
VERSE:Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
LABEL:12
VERSE:For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous;
VERSE:With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
