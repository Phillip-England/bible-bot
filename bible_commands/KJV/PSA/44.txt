BOOK:PSA
CHAPTER:44
TITLE:Psalm 44
LABEL:1
VERSE:We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
VERSE:What work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
LABEL:2
VERSE:  How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them;
VERSE:How thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
VERSE:Neither did their own arm save them:
VERSE:But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
VERSE:Because thou hadst a favour unto them.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thou art my King, O God: Command deliverances for Jacob.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Through thee will we push down our enemies:
VERSE:Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For I will not trust in my bow,
VERSE:Neither shall my sword save me.
LABEL:7
VERSE:But thou hast saved us from our enemies,
VERSE:And hast put them to shame that hated us.
LABEL:8
VERSE:In God we boast all the day long,
VERSE:And praise thy name for ever. Selah.
LABEL:9
VERSE:But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame;
VERSE:And goest not forth with our armies.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy:
VERSE:And they which hate us spoil for themselves.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat;
VERSE:And hast scattered us among the heathen.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Thou sellest thy people for nought,
VERSE:And dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours,
VERSE:A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thou makest us a byword among the heathen,
VERSE:A shaking of the head among the people.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My confusion is continually before me,
VERSE:And the shame of my face hath covered me,
LABEL:16
VERSE:For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth;
VERSE:By reason of the enemy and avenger.
LABEL:17
VERSE:All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
VERSE:Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Our heart is not turned back,
VERSE:Neither have our steps declined from thy way;
LABEL:19
VERSE:Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons,
VERSE:And covered us with the shadow of death.
LABEL:20
VERSE:If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
LABEL:21
VERSE:Shall not God search this out? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long;
VERSE:We are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
VERSE:Arise, cast us not off for ever.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
VERSE:And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
LABEL:25
VERSE:For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
VERSE:Our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Arise for our help,
VERSE:And redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
