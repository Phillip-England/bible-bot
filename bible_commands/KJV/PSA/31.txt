CHAPTER:31
TITLE:Psalm 31
LABEL:1
VERSE:In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust;
VERSE:Let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily:
VERSE:Be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For thou art my rock and my fortress;
VERSE:Therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me:
VERSE:For thou art my strength.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Into thine hand I commit my spirit:
VERSE:Thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I have hated them that regard lying vanities:
VERSE:But I trust in the LORD.
LABEL:7
VERSE:I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy:
VERSE:For thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
LABEL:8
VERSE:And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy:
VERSE:Thou hast set my feet in a large room.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble:
VERSE:Mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.
LABEL:10
VERSE:For my life is spent with grief,
VERSE:And my years with sighing:
VERSE:My strength faileth because of mine iniquity,
VERSE:And my bones are consumed.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours,
VERSE:And a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
VERSE:I am like a broken vessel.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For I have heard the slander of many:
VERSE:Fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, They devised to take away my life.
LABEL:14
VERSE:But I trusted in thee, O LORD:
VERSE:I said, Thou art my God.
LABEL:15
VERSE:My times are in thy hand:
VERSE:Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:
VERSE:Save me for thy mercies' sake.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
VERSE:Let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Let the lying lips be put to silence;
VERSE:Which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
LABEL:19
VERSE:  Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee;
VERSE:Which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
LABEL:20
VERSE:Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man:
VERSE:Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Blessed be the LORD:
VERSE:For he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For I said in my haste,
VERSE:I am cut off from before thine eyes:
VERSE:Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of
VERSE:My supplications when I cried unto thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:O love the LORD, all ye his saints:
VERSE:For the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart,
VERSE:All ye that hope in the LORD.
