TITLE:1 Thessalonians 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
LABEL:4
VERSE:But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
LABEL:7
VERSE:For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
LABEL:8
VERSE:But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
LABEL:10
VERSE:who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

VERSE:Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.

VERSE:and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
LABEL:15
VERSE:See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.
