CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Galatians 5
SECTION:Commends the New Life
LABEL:1
VERSE:Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
LABEL:5
VERSE:For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
LABEL:8
VERSE:This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
LABEL:9
VERSE:A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
LABEL:11
VERSE:And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
LABEL:16
VERSE:  This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
LABEL:20
VERSE:idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
LABEL:21
VERSE:envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
LABEL:23
VERSE:meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
LABEL:24
VERSE:And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
LABEL:25
VERSE:If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
