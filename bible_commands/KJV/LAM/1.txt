TRANSLATION:KJV
BOOK:LAM
CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Lamentations 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:How doth the city sit solitary,
VERSE:That was full of people!
VERSE:How is she become as a widow!
VERSE:She that was great among the nations,
VERSE:And princess among the provinces,
VERSE:How is she become tributary!
LABEL:2
VERSE:She weepeth sore in the night,
VERSE:And her tears are on her cheeks:
VERSE:Among all her lovers
VERSE:She hath none to comfort her:
VERSE:All her friends have dealt treacherously with her,
VERSE:They are become her enemies.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction,
VERSE:And because of great servitude:
VERSE:She dwelleth among the heathen,
VERSE:She findeth no rest:
VERSE:All her persecutors overtook her
VERSE:Between the straits.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The ways of Zion do mourn,
VERSE:Because none come to the solemn feasts:
VERSE:All her gates are desolate:
VERSE:Her priests sigh,
VERSE:Her virgins are afflicted,
VERSE:And she is in bitterness.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Her adversaries are the chief,
VERSE:Her enemies prosper;
VERSE:For the LORD hath afflicted her
VERSE:For the multitude of her transgressions:
VERSE:Her children are gone
VERSE:Into captivity before the enemy.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And from the daughter of Zion
VERSE:All her beauty is departed:
VERSE:Her princes are become like harts
VERSE:That find no pasture,
VERSE:And they are gone without strength
VERSE:Before the pursuer.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Jerusalem remembered
VERSE:In the days of her affliction and of her miseries
VERSE:All her pleasant things
VERSE:That she had in the days of old,
VERSE:When her people fell into the hand of the enemy,
VERSE:And none did help her:
VERSE:The adversaries saw her,
VERSE:And did mock at her sabbaths.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;
VERSE:Therefore she is removed:
VERSE:All that honoured her despise her,
VERSE:Because they have seen her nakedness:
VERSE:Yea, she sigheth,
VERSE:And turneth backward.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Her filthiness is in her skirts;
VERSE:She remembereth not her last end;
VERSE:Therefore she came down wonderfully:
VERSE:She had no comforter.
VERSE:O LORD, behold my affliction:
VERSE:For the enemy hath magnified himself.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The adversary hath spread out his hand
VERSE:Upon all her pleasant things:
VERSE:For she hath seen that the heathen
VERSE:Entered into her sanctuary,
VERSE:Whom thou didst command
VERSE:That they should not enter into thy congregation.
LABEL:11
VERSE:All her people sigh,
VERSE:They seek bread;
VERSE:They have given their pleasant things
VERSE:For meat to relieve the soul:
VERSE:See, O LORD, and consider;
VERSE:For I am become vile.
LABEL:12
VERSE:  Is it nothing to you,
VERSE:All ye that pass by?
VERSE:Behold, and see if there be any sorrow
VERSE:Like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me,
VERSE:Wherewith the LORD hath afflicted
VERSE:Me in the day of his fierce anger.
LABEL:13
VERSE:From above hath he sent fire into my bones,
VERSE:And it prevaileth against them:
VERSE:He hath spread a net for my feet,
VERSE:He hath turned me back:
VERSE:He hath made me desolate
VERSE:And faint all the day.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The yoke of my transgressions is bound
VERSE:By his hand:
VERSE:They are wreathed, and come up upon my neck:
VERSE:He hath made my strength to fall,
VERSE:The Lord hath delivered me into their hands,
VERSE:From whom I am not able to rise up.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men
VERSE:In the midst of me:
VERSE:He hath called an assembly against me
VERSE:To crush my young men:
VERSE:The Lord hath trodden the virgin,
VERSE:The daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For these things I weep;
VERSE:Mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,
VERSE:Because the comforter that should relieve my
VERSE:Soul is far from me:
VERSE:My children are desolate,
VERSE:Because the enemy prevailed.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Zion spreadeth forth her hands,
VERSE:And there is none to comfort her:
VERSE:The LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob,
VERSE:That his adversaries should be round about him:
VERSE:Jerusalem is as
VERSE:A menstruous woman among them.
LABEL:18
VERSE:The LORD is righteous;
VERSE:For I have rebelled against his commandment:
VERSE:Hear, I pray you, all people,
VERSE:And behold my sorrow:
VERSE:My virgins and my young men
VERSE:Are gone into captivity.
LABEL:19
VERSE:I called for my lovers,
VERSE:But they deceived me:
VERSE:My priests and mine elders
VERSE:Gave up the ghost in the city,
VERSE:While they sought their meat
VERSE:To relieve their souls.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress:
VERSE:My bowels are troubled;
VERSE:Mine heart is turned within me;
VERSE:For I have grievously rebelled:
VERSE:Abroad the sword bereaveth,
VERSE:At home there is as death.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They have heard that I sigh:
VERSE:There is none to comfort me:
VERSE:All mine enemies have heard of my trouble;
VERSE:They are glad that thou hast done it:
VERSE:Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
VERSE:And they shall be like unto me.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Let all their wickedness come before thee;
VERSE:And do unto them,
VERSE:As thou hast done unto me
VERSE:For all my transgressions:
VERSE:For my sighs are many,
VERSE:And my heart is faint.
