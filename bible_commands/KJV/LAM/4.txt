CHAPTER:4
TITLE:Lamentations 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:How is the gold become dim!
VERSE:How is the most fine gold changed!
VERSE:The stones of the sanctuary are poured out
VERSE:In the top of every street.
LABEL:2
VERSE:The precious sons of Zion,
VERSE:Comparable to fine gold,
VERSE:How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers,
VERSE:The work of the hands of the potter!
LABEL:3
VERSE:Even the sea monsters draw out the breast,
VERSE:They give suck to their young ones:
VERSE:The daughter of my people is become cruel,
VERSE:Like the ostriches in the wilderness.
LABEL:4
VERSE:The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth
VERSE:To the roof of his mouth for thirst:
VERSE:The young children ask bread,
VERSE:And no man breaketh it unto them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They that did feed delicately
VERSE:Are desolate in the streets:
VERSE:They that were brought up
VERSE:In scarlet embrace dunghills.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater
VERSE:Than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,
VERSE:That was overthrown as in a moment,
VERSE:And no hands stayed on her.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Her Nazarites were purer than snow,
VERSE:They were whiter than milk,
VERSE:They were more ruddy in body than rubies,
VERSE:Their polishing was of sapphire:
LABEL:8
VERSE:Their visage is blacker than a coal;
VERSE:They are not known in the streets:
VERSE:Their skin cleaveth to their bones;
VERSE:It is withered, it is become like a stick.
LABEL:9
VERSE:  They that be slain with the sword
VERSE:Are better than they that be slain with hunger:
VERSE:For these pine away, stricken
VERSE:Through for want of the fruits of the field.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The hands of the pitiful women
VERSE:Have sodden their own children:
VERSE:They were their meat
VERSE:In the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The LORD hath accomplished his fury;
VERSE:He hath poured out his fierce anger,
VERSE:And hath kindled a fire in Zion,
VERSE:And it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
LABEL:12
VERSE:The kings of the earth,
VERSE:And all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed
VERSE:That the adversary and the enemy should have entered
VERSE:Into the gates of Jerusalem.
LABEL:13
VERSE:For the sins of her prophets,
VERSE:And the iniquities of her priests,
VERSE:That have shed the blood
VERSE:Of the just in the midst of her,
LABEL:14
VERSE:They have wandered as blind men in the streets,
VERSE:They have polluted themselves with blood,
VERSE:So that men could not touch
VERSE:Their garments.
LABEL:15
VERSE:They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean;
VERSE:Depart, depart, touch not:
VERSE:When they fled away and wandered,
VERSE:They said among the heathen,
VERSE:They shall no more sojourn there.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The anger of the LORD hath divided them;
VERSE:He will no more regard them:
VERSE:They respected not the persons of the priests,
VERSE:They favoured not the elders.
LABEL:17
VERSE:As for us, our eyes as yet failed
VERSE:For our vain help:
VERSE:In our watching we have watched
VERSE:For a nation that could not save us.
LABEL:18
VERSE:They hunt our steps,
VERSE:That we cannot go in our streets:
VERSE:Our end is near, our days are fulfilled;
VERSE:For our end is come.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Our persecutors are swifter
VERSE:Than the eagles of the heaven:
VERSE:They pursued us upon the mountains,
VERSE:They laid wait for us in the wilderness.
LABEL:20
VERSE:The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD,
VERSE:Was taken in their pits,
VERSE:Of whom we said, Under his shadow
VERSE:We shall live among the heathen.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
VERSE:That dwellest in the land of Uz;
VERSE:The cup also shall pass through unto thee:
VERSE:Thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion;
VERSE:He will no more carry thee away into captivity:
VERSE:He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom;
VERSE:He will discover thy sins.
