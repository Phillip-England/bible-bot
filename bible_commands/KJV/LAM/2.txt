TRANSLATION:KJV
BOOK:LAM
CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Lamentations 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:How hath the Lord covered
VERSE:The daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,
VERSE:And cast down from heaven unto the earth
VERSE:The beauty of Israel,
VERSE:And remembered not his footstool
VERSE:In the day of his anger!
LABEL:2
VERSE:The Lord hath swallowed up
VERSE:All the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied:
VERSE:He hath thrown down in his wrath
VERSE:The strong holds of the daughter of Judah;
VERSE:He hath brought them down to the ground:
VERSE:He hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
LABEL:3
VERSE:He hath cut off in his fierce anger
VERSE:All the horn of Israel:
VERSE:He hath drawn back his right hand
VERSE:From before the enemy,
VERSE:And he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,
VERSE:Which devoureth round about.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He hath bent his bow like an enemy:
VERSE:He stood with his right hand as an adversary,
VERSE:And slew all that were pleasant to the eye
VERSE:In the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion:
VERSE:He poured out his fury like fire.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The Lord was as an enemy:
VERSE:He hath swallowed up Israel,
VERSE:He hath swallowed up all her palaces:
VERSE:He hath destroyed his strong holds,
VERSE:And hath increased in the daughter of Judah
VERSE:Mourning and lamentation.
LABEL:6
VERSE:And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden:
VERSE:He hath destroyed his places of the assembly:
VERSE:The LORD hath caused the solemn feasts
VERSE:And sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion,
VERSE:And hath despised in the indignation of his anger
VERSE:The king and the priest.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The Lord hath cast off his altar,
VERSE:He hath abhorred his sanctuary,
VERSE:He hath given up into the hand of the enemy
VERSE:The walls of her palaces;
VERSE:They have made a noise in the house of the LORD,
VERSE:As in the day of a solemn feast.
LABEL:8
VERSE:The LORD hath purposed to destroy
VERSE:The wall of the daughter of Zion:
VERSE:He hath stretched out a line,
VERSE:He hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying:
VERSE:Therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;
VERSE:They languished together.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Her gates are sunk into the ground;
VERSE:He hath destroyed and broken her bars:
VERSE:Her king and her princes are among the Gentiles:
VERSE:The law is no more;
VERSE:Her prophets also find
VERSE:No vision from the LORD.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The elders of the daughter of Zion
VERSE:Sit upon the ground, and keep silence:
VERSE:They have cast up dust upon their heads;
VERSE:They have girded themselves with sackcloth:
VERSE:The virgins of Jerusalem
VERSE:Hang down their heads to the ground.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Mine eyes do fail with tears,
VERSE:My bowels are troubled,
VERSE:My liver is poured upon the earth,
VERSE:For the destruction of the daughter of my people;
VERSE:Because the children and the sucklings swoon
VERSE:In the streets of the city.
LABEL:12
VERSE:They say to their mothers,
VERSE:Where is corn and wine?
VERSE:When they swooned as the wounded
VERSE:In the streets of the city,
VERSE:When their soul was poured out
VERSE:Into their mothers' bosom.
LABEL:13
VERSE:What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee,
VERSE:O daughter of Jerusalem?
VERSE:What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee,
VERSE:O virgin daughter of Zion?
VERSE:For thy breach is great like the sea:
VERSE:Who can heal thee?
LABEL:14
VERSE:Thy prophets have seen vain
VERSE:And foolish things for thee:
VERSE:And they have not discovered thine iniquity,
VERSE:To turn away thy captivity;
VERSE:But have seen for thee false burdens
VERSE:And causes of banishment.
LABEL:15
VERSE:All that pass by clap
VERSE:Their hands at thee;
VERSE:They hiss and wag their head
VERSE:At the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
VERSE:Is this the city that men call
VERSE:The perfection of beauty,
VERSE:The joy of the whole earth?
LABEL:16
VERSE:All thine enemies
VERSE:Have opened their mouth against thee:
VERSE:They hiss and gnash the teeth:
VERSE:They say, We have swallowed her up:
VERSE:Certainly this is the day that we looked for;
VERSE:We have found, we have seen it.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The LORD hath done that which he had devised;
VERSE:He hath fulfilled his word
VERSE:That he had commanded in the days of old:
VERSE:He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied:
VERSE:And he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee,
VERSE:He hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Their heart cried unto the Lord,
VERSE:O wall of the daughter of Zion,
VERSE:Let tears run down like a river
VERSE:Day and night:
VERSE:Give thyself no rest;
VERSE:Let not the apple of thine eye cease.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Arise, cry out in the night:
VERSE:In the beginning of the watches
VERSE:Pour out thine heart like water
VERSE:Before the face of the Lord:
VERSE:Lift up thy hands toward him for the life
VERSE:Of thy young children,
VERSE:That faint for hunger
VERSE:In the top of every street.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Behold, O LORD,
VERSE:And consider to whom thou hast done this.
VERSE:Shall the women eat their fruit,
VERSE:And children of a span long?
VERSE:Shall the priest and the prophet be slain
VERSE:In the sanctuary of the Lord?
LABEL:21
VERSE:The young and the old lie
VERSE:On the ground in the streets:
VERSE:My virgins and my young men
VERSE:Are fallen by the sword;
VERSE:Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger;
VERSE:Thou hast killed, and not pitied.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Thou hast called as in a solemn day
VERSE:My terrors round about,
VERSE:So that in the day of the LORD's anger
VERSE:None escaped nor remained:
VERSE:Those that I have swaddled and brought up hath
VERSE:Mine enemy consumed.
