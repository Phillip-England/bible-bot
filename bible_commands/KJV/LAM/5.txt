TITLE:Lamentations 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us:
VERSE:Consider, and behold our reproach.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Our inheritance is turned to strangers,
VERSE:Our houses to aliens.
LABEL:3
VERSE:We are orphans and fatherless,
VERSE:Our mothers are as widows.
LABEL:4
VERSE:We have drunken our water for money;
VERSE:Our wood is sold unto us.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Our necks are under persecution:
VERSE:We labour, and have no rest.
LABEL:6
VERSE:We have given the hand to the Egyptians,
VERSE:And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Our fathers have sinned, and are not;
VERSE:And we have borne their iniquities.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Servants have ruled over us:
VERSE:There is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.
LABEL:9
VERSE:We gat our bread with the peril of our lives
VERSE:Because of the sword of the wilderness.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Our skin was black like an oven
VERSE:Because of the terrible famine.
LABEL:11
VERSE:They ravished the women in Zion,
VERSE:And the maids in the cities of Judah.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Princes are hanged up by their hand:
VERSE:The faces of elders were not honoured.
LABEL:13
VERSE:They took the young men to grind,
VERSE:And the children fell under the wood.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The elders have ceased from the gate,
VERSE:The young men from their musick.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The joy of our heart is ceased;
VERSE:Our dance is turned into mourning.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The crown is fallen from our head:
VERSE:Woe unto us, that we have sinned!
LABEL:17
VERSE:For this our heart is faint;
VERSE:For these things our eyes are dim.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate,
VERSE:The foxes walk upon it.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever;
VERSE:Thy throne from generation to generation.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
VERSE:And forsake us so long time?
LABEL:21
VERSE:Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned;
VERSE:Renew our days as of old.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But thou hast utterly rejected us;
VERSE:Thou art very wroth against us.
