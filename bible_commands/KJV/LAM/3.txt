CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Lamentations 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:I am the man that hath seen affliction
VERSE:By the rod of his wrath.
LABEL:2
VERSE:He hath led me, and brought me
VERSE:Into darkness, but not into light.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand
VERSE:Against me all the day.
LABEL:4
VERSE:My flesh and my skin hath he made old;
VERSE:He hath broken my bones.
LABEL:5
VERSE:He hath builded against me,
VERSE:And compassed me with gall and travail.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He hath set me in dark places,
VERSE:As they that be dead of old.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out:
VERSE:He hath made my chain heavy.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Also when I cry and shout,
VERSE:He shutteth out my prayer.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone,
VERSE:He hath made my paths crooked.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He was unto me as a bear lying in wait,
VERSE:And as a lion in secret places.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces:
VERSE:He hath made me desolate.
LABEL:12
VERSE:He hath bent his bow, and set me
VERSE:As a mark for the arrow.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He hath caused the arrows of his quiver
VERSE:To enter into my reins.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I was a derision to all my people;
VERSE:And their song all the day.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He hath filled me with bitterness,
VERSE:He hath made me drunken with wormwood.
LABEL:16
VERSE:He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,
VERSE:He hath covered me with ashes.
LABEL:17
VERSE:And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace:
VERSE:I forgat prosperity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And I said, My strength and my hope
VERSE:Is perished from the LORD:
LABEL:19
VERSE:Remembering mine affliction and my misery,
VERSE:The wormwood and the gall.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My soul hath them still in remembrance,
VERSE:And is humbled in me.
LABEL:21
VERSE:This I recall to my mind,
VERSE:Therefore have I hope.
LABEL:22
VERSE:  It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed,
VERSE:Because his compassions fail not.
LABEL:23
VERSE:  They are new every morning:
VERSE:Great is thy faithfulness.
LABEL:24
VERSE:The LORD  is my portion, saith my soul;
VERSE:Therefore will I hope in him.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The LORD  is good unto them that wait for him,
VERSE:To the soul that seeketh him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:  It is good that a man should both hope and quietly
VERSE:Wait for the salvation of the LORD.
LABEL:27
VERSE:  It is good for a man that he bear
VERSE:The yoke in his youth.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He sitteth alone and keepeth silence,
VERSE:Because he hath borne it upon him.
LABEL:29
VERSE:He putteth his mouth in the dust;
VERSE:If so be there may be hope.
LABEL:30
VERSE:He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him:
VERSE:He is filled full with reproach.
LABEL:31
VERSE:For the Lord will not
VERSE:Cast off for ever:
LABEL:32
VERSE:But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
VERSE:According to the multitude of his mercies.
LABEL:33
VERSE:For he doth not afflict willingly
VERSE:Nor grieve the children of men.
LABEL:34
VERSE:To crush under his feet
VERSE:All the prisoners of the earth,
LABEL:35
VERSE:To turn aside the right of a man
VERSE:Before the face of the Most High,
LABEL:36
VERSE:To subvert a man in his cause,
VERSE:The Lord approveth not.
LABEL:37
VERSE:Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass,
VERSE:When the Lord commandeth it not?
LABEL:38
VERSE:Out of the mouth of the Most High
VERSE:Proceedeth not evil and good?
LABEL:39
VERSE:Wherefore doth a living man complain,
VERSE:A man for the punishment of his sins?
LABEL:40
VERSE:Let us search and try our ways,
VERSE:And turn again to the LORD.
LABEL:41
VERSE:Let us lift up our heart with our hands
VERSE:Unto God in the heavens.
LABEL:42
VERSE:We have transgressed and have rebelled:
VERSE:Thou hast not pardoned.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us:
VERSE:Thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
LABEL:44
VERSE:Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
VERSE:That our prayer should not pass through.
LABEL:45
VERSE:Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse
VERSE:In the midst of the people.
LABEL:46
VERSE:All our enemies
VERSE:Have opened their mouths against us.
LABEL:47
VERSE:Fear and a snare is come upon us,
VERSE:Desolation and destruction.
LABEL:48
VERSE:Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water
VERSE:For the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LABEL:49
VERSE:Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not,
VERSE:Without any intermission,
LABEL:50
VERSE:Till the LORD look down,
VERSE:And behold from heaven.
LABEL:51
VERSE:Mine eye affecteth mine heart
VERSE:Because of all the daughters of my city.
LABEL:52
VERSE:Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird,
VERSE:Without cause.
LABEL:53
VERSE:They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
VERSE:And cast a stone upon me.
LABEL:54
VERSE:Waters flowed over mine head;
VERSE:Then I said, I am cut off.
LABEL:55
VERSE:I called upon thy name, O LORD,
VERSE:Out of the low dungeon.
LABEL:56
VERSE:Thou hast heard my voice:
VERSE:Hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
LABEL:57
VERSE:Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee:
VERSE:Thou saidst, Fear not.
LABEL:58
VERSE:O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul;
VERSE:Thou hast redeemed my life.
LABEL:59
VERSE:O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong:
VERSE:Judge thou my cause.
LABEL:60
VERSE:Thou hast seen all their vengeance
VERSE:And all their imaginations against me.
LABEL:61
VERSE:Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD,
VERSE:And all their imaginations against me;
LABEL:62
VERSE:The lips of those that rose up against me,
VERSE:And their device against me all the day.
LABEL:63
VERSE:Behold their sitting down, and their rising up;
VERSE:I am their musick.
LABEL:64
VERSE:Render unto them a recompence, O LORD,
VERSE:According to the work of their hands.
LABEL:65
VERSE:Give them sorrow of heart,
VERSE:Thy curse unto them.
LABEL:66
VERSE:Persecute and destroy them in anger
VERSE:From under the heavens of the LORD.
