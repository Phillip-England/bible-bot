CHAPTER:2
TITLE:Proverbs 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
VERSE:And hide my commandments with thee;
LABEL:2
VERSE:So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,
VERSE:And apply thine heart to understanding;
LABEL:3
VERSE:Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,
VERSE:And liftest up thy voice for understanding;
LABEL:4
VERSE:If thou seekest her as silver,
VERSE:And searchest for her as for hid treasures;
LABEL:5
VERSE:Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD,
VERSE:And find the knowledge of God.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For the LORD giveth wisdom:
VERSE:Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous:
VERSE:He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He keepeth the paths of judgment,
VERSE:And preserveth the way of his saints.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment,
VERSE:And equity; yea, every good path.
LABEL:10
VERSE:When wisdom entereth into thine heart,
VERSE:And knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
LABEL:11
VERSE:Discretion shall preserve thee,
VERSE:Understanding shall keep thee:
LABEL:12
VERSE:To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,
VERSE:From the man that speaketh froward things;
LABEL:13
VERSE:Who leave the paths of uprightness,
VERSE:To walk in the ways of darkness;
LABEL:14
VERSE:Who rejoice to do evil,
VERSE:And delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
LABEL:15
VERSE:Whose ways are crooked,
VERSE:And they froward in their paths:
LABEL:16
VERSE:To deliver thee from the strange woman,
VERSE:Even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
LABEL:17
VERSE:Which forsaketh the guide of her youth,
VERSE:And forgetteth the covenant of her God.
LABEL:18
VERSE:For her house inclineth unto death,
VERSE:And her paths unto the dead.
LABEL:19
VERSE:None that go unto her return again,
VERSE:Neither take they hold of the paths of life.
LABEL:20
VERSE:That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
VERSE:And keep the paths of the righteous.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the upright shall dwell in the land,
VERSE:And the perfect shall remain in it.
LABEL:22
VERSE:But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth,
VERSE:And the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
