CHAPTER:17
TITLE:Proverbs 17
LABEL:1
VERSE:Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
VERSE:Than an house full of sacrifices with strife.
LABEL:2
VERSE:A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
VERSE:And shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold:
VERSE:But the LORD trieth the hearts.
LABEL:4
VERSE:A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips;
VERSE:And a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.
LABEL:5

VERSE:And he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Children's children are the crown of old men;
VERSE:And the glory of children are their fathers.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Excellent speech becometh not a fool:
VERSE:Much less do lying lips a prince.
LABEL:8
VERSE:A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
VERSE:Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
LABEL:9
VERSE:He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
VERSE:But he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.
LABEL:10
VERSE:A reproof entereth more into a wise man
VERSE:Than an hundred stripes into a fool.
LABEL:11
VERSE:An evil man seeketh only rebellion:
VERSE:Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
VERSE:Rather than a fool in his folly.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
VERSE:Evil shall not depart from his house.
LABEL:14
VERSE:The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
VERSE:Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
LABEL:15
VERSE:He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just,
VERSE:Even they both are abomination to the LORD.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom,
VERSE:Seeing he hath no heart to it?
LABEL:17
VERSE:A friend loveth at all times,
VERSE:And a brother is born for adversity.
LABEL:18
VERSE:A man void of understanding striketh hands,
VERSE:And becometh surety in the presence of his friend.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
VERSE:And he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.
LABEL:20
VERSE:He that hath a froward heart findeth no good:
VERSE:And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
LABEL:21
VERSE:He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow:
VERSE:And the father of a fool hath no joy.
LABEL:22
VERSE:A merry heart doeth good like a medicine:
VERSE:But a broken spirit drieth the bones.
LABEL:23
VERSE:A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom
VERSE:To pervert the ways of judgment.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Wisdom is before him that hath understanding;
VERSE:But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
LABEL:25
VERSE:A foolish son is a grief to his father,
VERSE:And bitterness to her that bare him.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Also to punish the just is not good,
VERSE:Nor to strike princes for equity.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He that hath knowledge spareth his words:
VERSE:And a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:
VERSE:And he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
