CHAPTER:9
TITLE:Proverbs 9
LABEL:1
VERSE:Wisdom hath builded her house,
VERSE:She hath hewn out her seven pillars:
LABEL:2
VERSE:She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;
VERSE:She hath also furnished her table.
LABEL:3
VERSE:She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth
VERSE:Upon the highest places of the city,
LABEL:4
VERSE:Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
VERSE:As for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
LABEL:5
VERSE:Come, eat of my bread,
VERSE:And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Forsake the foolish, and live;
VERSE:And go in the way of understanding.
LABEL:7
VERSE:He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame:
VERSE:And he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee:
VERSE:Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
VERSE:Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The fear of the LORD  is the beginning of wisdom:
VERSE:And the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
LABEL:11
VERSE:For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
VERSE:And the years of thy life shall be increased.
LABEL:12
VERSE:If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself:
VERSE:But if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
LABEL:13
VERSE:A foolish woman is clamorous:
VERSE:She is simple, and knoweth nothing.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For she sitteth at the door of her house,
VERSE:On a seat in the high places of the city,
LABEL:15
VERSE:To call passengers
VERSE:Who go right on their ways:
LABEL:16
VERSE:Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
VERSE:And as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
LABEL:17
VERSE:Stolen waters are sweet,
VERSE:And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But he knoweth not that the dead are there;
VERSE:And that her guests are in the depths of hell.
