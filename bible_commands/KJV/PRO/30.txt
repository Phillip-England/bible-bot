CHAPTER:30
TITLE:Proverbs 30
SECTION:Words of Agur
LABEL:1
VERSE:The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy:
VERSE:The man spake unto Ithiel,
VERSE:even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
LABEL:2
VERSE:Surely I am more brutish than any man,
VERSE:And have not the understanding of a man.
LABEL:3
VERSE:I neither learned wisdom,
VERSE:Nor have the knowledge of the holy.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?
VERSE:Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
VERSE:Who hath bound the waters in a garment?
VERSE:Who hath established all the ends of the earth?
VERSE:What is his name, and what is his son's name,
VERSE:If thou canst tell?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Every word of God is pure:
VERSE:He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Add thou not unto his words,
VERSE:Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Two things have I required of thee;
VERSE:Deny me them not before I die:
LABEL:8
VERSE:Remove far from me vanity and lies:
VERSE:Give me neither poverty nor riches;
VERSE:Feed me with food convenient for me:
LABEL:9
VERSE:Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say,
VERSE:Who is the LORD?
VERSE:Or lest I be poor, and steal,
VERSE:And take the name of my God in vain.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Accuse not a servant unto his master,
VERSE:Lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
LABEL:11
VERSE:  There is a generation that curseth their father,
VERSE:And doth not bless their mother.
LABEL:12
VERSE:  There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,
VERSE:And yet is not washed from their filthiness.
LABEL:13
VERSE:  There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes!
VERSE:And their eyelids are lifted up.
LABEL:14
VERSE:  There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives,
VERSE:To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.
VERSE:There are three things that are never satisfied,
VERSE:Yea, four things say not,
VERSE:It is enough:
LABEL:16
VERSE:The grave; and the barren womb;
VERSE:The earth that is not filled with water;
VERSE:And the fire that saith not, It is enough.
LABEL:17
VERSE:The eye that mocketh at his father,
VERSE:And despiseth to obey his mother,
VERSE:The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
VERSE:And the young eagles shall eat it.
LABEL:18
VERSE:There be three things which are too wonderful for me,
VERSE:Yea, four which I know not:
LABEL:19
VERSE:The way of an eagle in the air;
VERSE:The way of a serpent upon a rock;
VERSE:The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
VERSE:And the way of a man with a maid.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Such is the way of an adulterous woman;
VERSE:She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
VERSE:And saith, I have done no wickedness.
LABEL:21
VERSE:For three things the earth is disquieted,
VERSE:And for four which it cannot bear:
LABEL:22
VERSE:For a servant when he reigneth;
VERSE:And a fool when he is filled with meat;
LABEL:23
VERSE:For an odious woman when she is married;
VERSE:And an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
LABEL:24
VERSE:There be four things which are little upon the earth,
VERSE:But they are exceeding wise:
LABEL:25
VERSE:The ants are a people not strong,
VERSE:Yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
LABEL:26
VERSE:The conies are but a feeble folk,
VERSE:Yet make they their houses in the rocks;
LABEL:27
VERSE:The locusts have no king,
VERSE:Yet go they forth all of them by bands;
LABEL:28
VERSE:The spider taketh hold with her hands,
VERSE:And is in kings' palaces.
LABEL:29
VERSE:There be three things which go well,
VERSE:Yea, four are comely in going:
LABEL:30
VERSE:A lion which is strongest among beasts,
VERSE:And turneth not away for any;
LABEL:31
VERSE:An greyhound; an he goat also;
VERSE:And a king, against whom there is no rising up.
LABEL:32
VERSE:If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
VERSE:Or if thou hast thought evil,
VERSE:Lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
LABEL:33
VERSE:Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
VERSE:And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
VERSE:So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
