CHAPTER:25
TITLE:Proverbs 25
SECTION:Proverbs of Solomon
LABEL:1
VERSE:These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
LABEL:2
VERSE:  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing:
VERSE:But the honour of kings is to search out a matter.
LABEL:3
VERSE:The heaven for height, and the earth for depth,
VERSE:And the heart of kings is unsearchable.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Take away the dross from the silver,
VERSE:And there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Take away the wicked from before the king,
VERSE:And his throne shall be established in righteousness.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king,
VERSE:And stand not in the place of great men:
LABEL:7
VERSE:For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
VERSE:Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince
VERSE:Whom thine eyes have seen.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Go not forth hastily to strive,
VERSE:Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof,
VERSE:When thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself;
VERSE:And discover not a secret to another:
LABEL:10
VERSE:Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame,
VERSE:And thine infamy turn not away.
LABEL:11
VERSE:A word fitly spoken
VERSE:Is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
LABEL:12
VERSE:  As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
VERSE:So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
LABEL:13
VERSE:As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
VERSE:So is a faithful messenger to them that send him:
VERSE:For he refresheth the soul of his masters.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift
VERSE:Is like clouds and wind without rain.
LABEL:15
VERSE:By long forbearing is a prince persuaded,
VERSE:And a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
VERSE:Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house;
VERSE:Lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.
LABEL:18
VERSE:A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour
VERSE:Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
VERSE:Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
LABEL:20
VERSE:  As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre,
VERSE:So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
LABEL:21
VERSE:If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
VERSE:And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
LABEL:22
VERSE:For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
VERSE:And the LORD shall reward thee.
LABEL:23
VERSE:The north wind driveth away rain:
VERSE:So doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
LABEL:24
VERSE:  It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
VERSE:Than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
LABEL:25
VERSE:  As cold waters to a thirsty soul,
VERSE:So is good news from a far country.
LABEL:26
VERSE:A righteous man falling down before the wicked
VERSE:Is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
LABEL:27
VERSE:  It is not good to eat much honey:
VERSE:So for men to search their own glory is not glory.
LABEL:28
VERSE:He that hath no rule over his own spirit
VERSE:Is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
