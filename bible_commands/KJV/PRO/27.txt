CHAPTER:27
TITLE:Proverbs 27
LABEL:1
VERSE:Boast not thyself of to morrow;
VERSE:For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
VERSE:A stranger, and not thine own lips.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
VERSE:But a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous;
VERSE:But who is able to stand before envy?
LABEL:5
VERSE:Open rebuke is better
VERSE:Than secret love.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
VERSE:But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The full soul loatheth an honeycomb;
VERSE:But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
LABEL:8
VERSE:As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
VERSE:So is a man that wandereth from his place.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:
VERSE:So doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
VERSE:Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:
VERSE:For better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
VERSE:That I may answer him that reproacheth me.
LABEL:12
VERSE:A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself;
VERSE:But the simple pass on, and are punished.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Take his garment that is surety for a stranger,
VERSE:And take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
LABEL:14
VERSE:He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
VERSE:It shall be counted a curse to him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:A continual dropping in a very rainy day
VERSE:And a contentious woman are alike.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind,
VERSE:And the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Iron sharpeneth iron;
VERSE:So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof:
VERSE:So he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
LABEL:19
VERSE:As in water face answereth to face,
VERSE:So the heart of man to man.
LABEL:20
VERSE:Hell and destruction are never full;
VERSE:So the eyes of man are never satisfied.
LABEL:21
VERSE:  As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold;
VERSE:So is a man to his praise.
LABEL:22
VERSE:Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,
VERSE:Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
VERSE:And look well to thy herds.
LABEL:24
VERSE:For riches are not for ever:
VERSE:And doth the crown endure to every generation?
LABEL:25
VERSE:The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself,
VERSE:And herbs of the mountains are gathered.
LABEL:26
VERSE:The lambs are for thy clothing,
VERSE:And the goats are the price of the field.
LABEL:27
VERSE:And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household,
VERSE:And for the maintenance for thy maidens.
