CHAPTER:24
TITLE:Proverbs 24
LABEL:1
VERSE:Be not thou envious against evil men,
VERSE:Neither desire to be with them.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For their heart studieth destruction,
VERSE:And their lips talk of mischief.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Through wisdom is an house builded;
VERSE:And by understanding it is established:
LABEL:4
VERSE:And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled
VERSE:With all precious and pleasant riches.
LABEL:5
VERSE:A wise man is strong;
VERSE:Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war:
VERSE:And in multitude of counsellors there is safety.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wisdom is too high for a fool:
VERSE:He openeth not his mouth in the gate.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He that deviseth to do evil
VERSE:Shall be called a mischievous person.
LABEL:9
VERSE:The thought of foolishness is sin:
VERSE:And the scorner is an abomination to men.
LABEL:10
VERSE:  If thou faint in the day of adversity,
VERSE:Thy strength is small.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death,
VERSE:And those that are ready to be slain;
LABEL:12
VERSE:If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not;
VERSE:Doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it?
VERSE:And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?
VERSE:And shall not he render to every man according to his works?
LABEL:13
VERSE:My son, eat thou honey, because it is good;
VERSE:And the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:
LABEL:14
VERSE:So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul:
VERSE:When thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward,
VERSE:And thy expectation shall not be cut off.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
VERSE:Spoil not his resting place:
LABEL:16
VERSE:For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again:
VERSE:But the wicked shall fall into mischief.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
VERSE:And let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
LABEL:18
VERSE:Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him,
VERSE:And he turn away his wrath from him.
LABEL:19
VERSE:Fret not thyself because of evil men,
VERSE:Neither be thou envious at the wicked;
LABEL:20
VERSE:For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
VERSE:The candle of the wicked shall be put out.
LABEL:21
VERSE:My son, fear thou the LORD and the king:
VERSE:And meddle not with them that are given to change:
LABEL:22
VERSE:For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
VERSE:And who knoweth the ruin of them both?
LABEL:23
VERSE:These things also belong to the wise.
VERSE:It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous;
VERSE:Him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
LABEL:25
VERSE:But to them that rebuke him shall be delight,
VERSE:And a good blessing shall come upon them.
LABEL:26
VERSE:  Every man shall kiss his lips
VERSE:That giveth a right answer.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Prepare thy work without,
VERSE:And make it fit for thyself in the field;
VERSE:And afterwards build thine house.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause;
VERSE:And deceive not with thy lips.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me:
VERSE:I will render to the man according to his work.
LABEL:30
VERSE:I went by the field of the slothful,
VERSE:And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
LABEL:31
VERSE:And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,
VERSE:And nettles had covered the face thereof,
VERSE:And the stone wall thereof was broken down.
LABEL:32
VERSE:Then I saw, and considered it well:
VERSE:I looked upon it, and received instruction.
LABEL:33
VERSE:  Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
VERSE:A little folding of the hands to sleep:
LABEL:34
VERSE:So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth;
VERSE:And thy want as an armed man.
