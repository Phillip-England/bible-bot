CHAPTER:3
TITLE:Proverbs 3
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, forget not my law;
VERSE:But let thine heart keep my commandments:
LABEL:2
VERSE:For length of days, and long life,
VERSE:And peace, shall they add to thee.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Let not mercy and truth forsake thee:
VERSE:Bind them about thy neck;
VERSE:Write them upon the table of thine heart:
LABEL:4
VERSE:So shalt thou find favour and good understanding
VERSE:In the sight of God and man.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
VERSE:And lean not unto thine own understanding.
LABEL:6
VERSE:In all thy ways acknowledge him,
VERSE:And he shall direct thy paths.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Be not wise in thine own eyes:
VERSE:Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
LABEL:8
VERSE:It shall be health to thy navel,
VERSE:And marrow to thy bones.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Honour the LORD with thy substance,
VERSE:And with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
LABEL:10
VERSE:So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
VERSE:And thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
LABEL:11
VERSE:My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;
VERSE:Neither be weary of his correction:
LABEL:12
VERSE:For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth;
VERSE:Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,
VERSE:And the man that getteth understanding.
LABEL:14
VERSE:For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,
VERSE:And the gain thereof than fine gold.
LABEL:15
VERSE:She is more precious than rubies:
VERSE:And all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Length of days is in her right hand;
VERSE:And in her left hand riches and honour.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
VERSE:And all her paths are peace.
LABEL:18
VERSE:She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:
VERSE:And happy is every one that retaineth her.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth;
VERSE:By understanding hath he established the heavens.
LABEL:20
VERSE:By his knowledge the depths are broken up,
VERSE:And the clouds drop down the dew.
LABEL:21
VERSE:My son, let not them depart from thine eyes:
VERSE:Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
LABEL:22
VERSE:So shall they be life unto thy soul,
VERSE:And grace to thy neck.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely,
VERSE:And thy foot shall not stumble.
LABEL:24
VERSE:When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:
VERSE:Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Be not afraid of sudden fear,
VERSE:Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For the LORD shall be thy confidence,
VERSE:And shall keep thy foot from being taken.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
VERSE:When it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again,
VERSE:And to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
LABEL:29
VERSE:Devise not evil against thy neighbour,
VERSE:Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
LABEL:30
VERSE:Strive not with a man without cause,
VERSE:If he have done thee no harm.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Envy thou not the oppressor,
VERSE:And choose none of his ways.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For the froward is abomination to the LORD:
VERSE:But his secret is with the righteous.
LABEL:33
VERSE:The curse of the LORD  is in the house of the wicked:
VERSE:But he blesseth the habitation of the just.
LABEL:34
VERSE:Surely he scorneth the scorners:
VERSE:But he giveth grace unto the lowly.
LABEL:35
VERSE:The wise shall inherit glory:
VERSE:But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
