BOOK:PRO
CHAPTER:1
TITLE:Proverbs 1
LABEL:1
VERSE:The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
LABEL:2
VERSE:To know wisdom and instruction;
VERSE:To perceive the words of understanding;
LABEL:3
VERSE:To receive the instruction of wisdom,
VERSE:Justice, and judgment, and equity;
LABEL:4
VERSE:To give subtilty to the simple,
VERSE:To the young man knowledge and discretion.
LABEL:5
VERSE:A wise man will hear, and will increase learning;
VERSE:And a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
LABEL:6
VERSE:To understand a proverb, and the interpretation;
VERSE:The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The fear of the LORD  is the beginning of knowledge:
VERSE:But fools despise wisdom and instruction.
LABEL:8
VERSE:My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
VERSE:And forsake not the law of thy mother:
LABEL:9
VERSE:For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,
VERSE:And chains about thy neck.
LABEL:10
VERSE:My son, if sinners entice thee,
VERSE:Consent thou not.
LABEL:11
VERSE:If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood,
VERSE:Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let us swallow them up alive as the grave;
VERSE:And whole, as those that go down into the pit:
LABEL:13
VERSE:We shall find all precious substance,
VERSE:We shall fill our houses with spoil:
LABEL:14
VERSE:Cast in thy lot among us;
VERSE:Let us all have one purse:
LABEL:15
VERSE:My son, walk not thou in the way with them;
VERSE:Refrain thy foot from their path:
LABEL:16
VERSE:For their feet run to evil,
VERSE:And make haste to shed blood.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Surely in vain the net is spread
VERSE:In the sight of any bird.
LABEL:18
VERSE:And they lay wait for their own blood;
VERSE:They lurk privily for their own lives.
LABEL:19
VERSE:So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;
VERSE:Which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
SECTION:The Cry of Wisdom
LABEL:20
VERSE:Wisdom crieth without;
VERSE:She uttereth her voice in the streets:
LABEL:21
VERSE:She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates:
VERSE:In the city she uttereth her words, saying,
LABEL:22
VERSE:How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?
VERSE:And the scorners delight in their scorning,
VERSE:And fools hate knowledge?
LABEL:23
VERSE:Turn you at my reproof:
VERSE:Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,
VERSE:I will make known my words unto you.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Because I have called, and ye refused;
VERSE:I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
LABEL:25
VERSE:But ye have set at nought all my counsel,
VERSE:And would none of my reproof:
LABEL:26
VERSE:I also will laugh at your calamity;
VERSE:I will mock when your fear cometh;
LABEL:27
VERSE:When your fear cometh as desolation,
VERSE:And your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;
VERSE:When distress and anguish cometh upon you.
LABEL:28
VERSE:Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer;
VERSE:They shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
LABEL:29
VERSE:For that they hated knowledge,
VERSE:And did not choose the fear of the LORD:
LABEL:30
VERSE:They would none of my counsel:
VERSE:They despised all my reproof.
LABEL:31
VERSE:Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
VERSE:And be filled with their own devices.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,
VERSE:And the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
LABEL:33
VERSE:But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely,
VERSE:And shall be quiet from fear of evil.
