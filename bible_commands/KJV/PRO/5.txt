CHAPTER:5
TITLE:Proverbs 5
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, attend unto my wisdom,
VERSE:And bow thine ear to my understanding:
LABEL:2
VERSE:That thou mayest regard discretion,
VERSE:And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb,
VERSE:And her mouth is smoother than oil:
LABEL:4
VERSE:But her end is bitter as wormwood,
VERSE:Sharp as a twoedged sword.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Her feet go down to death;
VERSE:Her steps take hold on hell.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life,
VERSE:Her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Hear me now therefore, O ye children,
VERSE:And depart not from the words of my mouth.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Remove thy way far from her,
VERSE:And come not nigh the door of her house:
LABEL:9
VERSE:Lest thou give thine honour unto others,
VERSE:And thy years unto the cruel:
LABEL:10
VERSE:Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth;
VERSE:And thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
LABEL:11
VERSE:And thou mourn at the last,
VERSE:When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
LABEL:12
VERSE:And say, How have I hated instruction,
VERSE:And my heart despised reproof;
LABEL:13
VERSE:And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
VERSE:Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
LABEL:14
VERSE:I was almost in all evil
VERSE:In the midst of the congregation and assembly.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
VERSE:And running waters out of thine own well.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad,
VERSE:And rivers of waters in the streets.
LABEL:17
VERSE:Let them be only thine own,
VERSE:And not strangers' with thee.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Let thy fountain be blessed:
VERSE:And rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
LABEL:19
VERSE:  Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe;
VERSE:Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
VERSE:And be thou ravished always with her love.
LABEL:20
VERSE:And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
VERSE:And embrace the bosom of a stranger?
LABEL:21
VERSE:For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD,
VERSE:And he pondereth all his goings.
LABEL:22
VERSE:His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself,
VERSE:And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He shall die without instruction;
VERSE:And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
