CHAPTER:7
TITLE:Proverbs 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:My son, keep my words,
VERSE:And lay up my commandments with thee.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Keep my commandments, and live;
VERSE:And my law as the apple of thine eye.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Bind them upon thy fingers,
VERSE:Write them upon the table of thine heart.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister;
VERSE:And call understanding thy kinswoman:
LABEL:5
VERSE:That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
VERSE:From the stranger which flattereth with her words.
LABEL:6
VERSE:For at the window of my house
VERSE:I looked through my casement,
LABEL:7
VERSE:And beheld among the simple ones,
VERSE:I discerned among the youths,
VERSE:A young man void of understanding,
LABEL:8
VERSE:Passing through the street near her corner;
VERSE:And he went the way to her house,
LABEL:9
VERSE:In the twilight, in the evening,
VERSE:In the black and dark night:
LABEL:10
VERSE:And, behold, there met him a woman
VERSE:With the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
LABEL:11
VERSE:(She is loud and stubborn;
VERSE:Her feet abide not in her house:
LABEL:12
VERSE:Now is she without, now in the streets,
VERSE:And lieth in wait at every corner.)
LABEL:13
VERSE:So she caught him, and kissed him,
VERSE:And with an impudent face said unto him,
LABEL:14
VERSE:  I have peace offerings with me;
VERSE:This day have I payed my vows.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
VERSE:Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
LABEL:16
VERSE:I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,
VERSE:With carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I have perfumed my bed
VERSE:With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning:
VERSE:Let us solace ourselves with loves.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For the goodman is not at home,
VERSE:He is gone a long journey:
LABEL:20
VERSE:He hath taken a bag of money with him,
VERSE:And will come home at the day appointed.
LABEL:21
VERSE:With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,
VERSE:With the flattering of her lips she forced him.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He goeth after her straightway,
VERSE:As an ox goeth to the slaughter,
VERSE:Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
LABEL:23
VERSE:Till a dart strike through his liver;
VERSE:As a bird hasteth to the snare,
VERSE:And knoweth not that it is for his life.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children,
VERSE:And attend to the words of my mouth.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let not thine heart decline to her ways,
VERSE:Go not astray in her paths.
LABEL:26
VERSE:For she hath cast down many wounded:
VERSE:Yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Her house is the way to hell,
VERSE:Going down to the chambers of death.
