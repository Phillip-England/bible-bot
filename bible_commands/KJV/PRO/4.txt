SECTION:A Father's Instruction
LABEL:1
VERSE:Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father,
VERSE:And attend to know understanding.
LABEL:2
VERSE:For I give you good doctrine,
VERSE:Forsake ye not my law.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For I was my father's son,
VERSE:Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
LABEL:4
VERSE:He taught me also, and said unto me,
VERSE:Let thine heart retain my words:
VERSE:Keep my commandments, and live.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Get wisdom, get understanding:
VERSE:Forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee:
VERSE:Love her, and she shall keep thee.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom:
VERSE:And with all thy getting get understanding.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Exalt her, and she shall promote thee:
VERSE:She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
LABEL:9
VERSE:She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace:
VERSE:A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
VERSE:And the years of thy life shall be many.
LABEL:11
VERSE:I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;
VERSE:I have led thee in right paths.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;
VERSE:And when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go:
VERSE:Keep her; for she is thy life.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Enter not into the path of the wicked,
VERSE:And go not in the way of evil men.
LABEL:15
VERSE:Avoid it, pass not by it,
VERSE:Turn from it, and pass away.
LABEL:16
VERSE:For they sleep not, except they have done mischief;
VERSE:And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
LABEL:17
VERSE:For they eat the bread of wickedness,
VERSE:And drink the wine of violence.
LABEL:18
VERSE:But the path of the just is as the shining light,
VERSE:That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
LABEL:19
VERSE:The way of the wicked is as darkness:
VERSE:They know not at what they stumble.
LABEL:20
VERSE:My son, attend to my words;
VERSE:Incline thine ear unto my sayings.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Let them not depart from thine eyes;
VERSE:Keep them in the midst of thine heart.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For they are life unto those that find them,
VERSE:And health to all their flesh.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Keep thy heart with all diligence;
VERSE:For out of it are the issues of life.
LABEL:24
VERSE:Put away from thee a froward mouth,
VERSE:And perverse lips put far from thee.
LABEL:25
VERSE:Let thine eyes look right on,
VERSE:And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
LABEL:26
VERSE:Ponder the path of thy feet,
VERSE:And let all thy ways be established.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
VERSE:Remove thy foot from evil.
