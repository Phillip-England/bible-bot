VERSE:But by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A poor man that oppresseth the poor
VERSE:Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
LABEL:4
VERSE:They that forsake the law praise the wicked:
VERSE:But such as keep the law contend with them.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Evil men understand not judgment:
VERSE:But they that seek the LORD understand all things.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness,
VERSE:Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son:
VERSE:But he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.
LABEL:8
VERSE:He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance,
VERSE:He shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

VERSE:Even his prayer shall be abomination.
LABEL:10
VERSE:Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way,
VERSE:He shall fall himself into his own pit:
VERSE:But the upright shall have good things in possession.
LABEL:11
VERSE:The rich man is wise in his own conceit;
VERSE:But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
LABEL:12
VERSE:When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory:
VERSE:But when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

VERSE:He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
VERSE:But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Happy is the man that feareth alway:
VERSE:But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
LABEL:15
VERSE:  As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear;
VERSE:So is a wicked ruler over the poor people.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor:
VERSE:But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
LABEL:17
VERSE:A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person
VERSE:Shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved:
VERSE:But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
LABEL:19
VERSE:He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
VERSE:But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
LABEL:20
VERSE:A faithful man shall abound with blessings:
VERSE:But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
LABEL:21
VERSE:To have respect of persons is not good:
VERSE:For for a piece of bread that man will transgress.
LABEL:22
VERSE:He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye,
VERSE:And considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
LABEL:23
VERSE:He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour
VERSE:Than he that flattereth with the tongue.

VERSE:Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression;
VERSE:The same is the companion of a destroyer.
LABEL:25
VERSE:He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:
VERSE:But he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
LABEL:26
VERSE:He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
VERSE:But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
LABEL:27
VERSE:He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack:
VERSE:But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
LABEL:28
VERSE:When the wicked rise, men hide themselves:
VERSE:But when they perish, the righteous increase.
