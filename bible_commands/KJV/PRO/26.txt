LABEL:1
VERSE:As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
VERSE:So honour is not seemly for a fool.
LABEL:2
VERSE:As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying,
VERSE:So the curse causeless shall not come.
LABEL:3
VERSE:A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
VERSE:And a rod for the fool's back.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Answer not a fool according to his folly,
VERSE:Lest thou also be like unto him.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Answer a fool according to his folly,
VERSE:Lest he be wise in his own conceit.
LABEL:6
VERSE:He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
VERSE:Cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.
LABEL:7
VERSE:The legs of the lame are not equal:
VERSE:So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
LABEL:8
VERSE:As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,
VERSE:So is he that giveth honour to a fool.
LABEL:9
VERSE:  As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,
VERSE:So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
LABEL:10
VERSE:The great God that formed all things
VERSE:Both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.
LABEL:11
VERSE:As a dog returneth to his vomit,
VERSE:So a fool returneth to his folly.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
VERSE:There is more hope of a fool than of him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way;
VERSE:A lion is in the streets.
LABEL:14
VERSE:  As the door turneth upon his hinges,
VERSE:So doth the slothful upon his bed.
LABEL:15
VERSE:The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom;
VERSE:It grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.
LABEL:16
VERSE:The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
VERSE:Than seven men that can render a reason.
LABEL:17
VERSE:He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him,
VERSE:Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.
LABEL:18
VERSE:As a mad man who casteth firebrands,
VERSE:Arrows, and death,
LABEL:19
VERSE:So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour,
VERSE:And saith, Am not I in sport?
LABEL:20
VERSE:Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out:
VERSE:So where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
LABEL:21
VERSE:  As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire;
VERSE:So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
LABEL:22
VERSE:The words of a talebearer are as wounds,
VERSE:And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
LABEL:23
VERSE:Burning lips and a wicked heart
VERSE:Are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
LABEL:24
VERSE:He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,
VERSE:And layeth up deceit within him;
LABEL:25
VERSE:When he speaketh fair, believe him not:
VERSE:For there are seven abominations in his heart.
LABEL:26
VERSE:  Whose hatred is covered by deceit,
VERSE:His wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.
LABEL:27
VERSE:Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:
VERSE:And he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
LABEL:28
VERSE:A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it;
VERSE:And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
