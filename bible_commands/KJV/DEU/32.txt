CHAPTER:32
TITLE:Deuteronomy 32
SECTION:The Song of Moses
LABEL:1
VERSE:Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;
VERSE:And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
LABEL:2
VERSE:My doctrine shall drop as the rain,
VERSE:My speech shall distil as the dew,
VERSE:As the small rain upon the tender herb,
VERSE:And as the showers upon the grass:
LABEL:3
VERSE:Because I will publish the name of the LORD:
VERSE:Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
LABEL:4
VERSE:  He is the Rock, his work is perfect:
VERSE:For all his ways are judgment:
VERSE:A God of truth and without iniquity,
VERSE:Just and right is he.
LABEL:5
VERSE:They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children:
VERSE:They are a perverse and crooked generation.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Do ye thus requite the LORD,
VERSE:O foolish people and unwise?
VERSE:Is not he thy father that hath bought thee?
VERSE:Hath he not made thee, and established thee?
LABEL:7
VERSE:Remember the days of old,
VERSE:Consider the years of many generations:
VERSE:Ask thy father, and he will shew thee;
VERSE:Thy elders, and they will tell thee.
LABEL:8
VERSE:When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
VERSE:When he separated the sons of Adam,
VERSE:He set the bounds of the people
VERSE:According to the number of the children of Israel.
LABEL:9
VERSE:For the LORD's portion is his people;
VERSE:Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
LABEL:10
VERSE:He found him in a desert land,
VERSE:And in the waste howling wilderness;
VERSE:He led him about, he instructed him,
VERSE:He kept him as the apple of his eye.
LABEL:11
VERSE:As an eagle stirreth up her nest,
VERSE:Fluttereth over her young,
VERSE:Spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
VERSE:Beareth them on her wings:
LABEL:12
VERSE:  So the LORD alone did lead him,
VERSE:And there was no strange god with him.
LABEL:13
VERSE:He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
VERSE:That he might eat the increase of the fields;
VERSE:And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,
VERSE:And oil out of the flinty rock;
LABEL:14
VERSE:Butter of kine, and milk of sheep,
VERSE:With fat of lambs,
VERSE:And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
VERSE:With the fat of kidneys of wheat;
VERSE:And thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
LABEL:15
VERSE:But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:
VERSE:Thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness;
VERSE:Then he forsook God which made him,
VERSE:And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
LABEL:16
VERSE:They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods,
VERSE:With abominations provoked they him to anger.
LABEL:17
VERSE:They sacrificed unto devils, not to God;
VERSE:To gods whom they knew not,
VERSE:To new gods that came newly up,
VERSE:Whom your fathers feared not.
LABEL:18
VERSE:Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,
VERSE:And hast forgotten God that formed thee.
LABEL:19
VERSE:And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them,
VERSE:Because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
LABEL:20
VERSE:And he said, I will hide my face from them,
VERSE:I will see what their end shall be:
VERSE:For they are a very froward generation,
VERSE:Children in whom is no faith.
LABEL:21
VERSE:They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
VERSE:They have provoked me to anger with their vanities:
VERSE:And I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people;
VERSE:I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
LABEL:22
VERSE:For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
VERSE:And shall burn unto the lowest hell,
VERSE:And shall consume the earth with her increase,
VERSE:And set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
LABEL:23
VERSE:I will heap mischiefs upon them;
VERSE:I will spend mine arrows upon them.
LABEL:24
VERSE:  They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
VERSE:And with bitter destruction:
VERSE:I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them,
VERSE:With the poison of serpents of the dust.
LABEL:25
VERSE:The sword without,
VERSE:And terror within,
VERSE:Shall destroy both the young man and the virgin,
VERSE:The suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
LABEL:26
VERSE:I said, I would scatter them into corners,
VERSE:I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
LABEL:27
VERSE:Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy,
VERSE:Lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,
VERSE:And lest they should say, Our hand is high,
VERSE:And the LORD hath not done all this.
LABEL:28
VERSE:For they are a nation void of counsel,
VERSE:Neither is there any understanding in them.
LABEL:29
VERSE:O that they were wise, that they understood this,
VERSE:That they would consider their latter end!
LABEL:30
VERSE:How should one chase a thousand,
VERSE:And two put ten thousand to flight,
VERSE:Except their Rock had sold them,
VERSE:And the LORD had shut them up?
LABEL:31
VERSE:For their rock is not as our Rock,
VERSE:Even our enemies themselves being judges.
LABEL:32
VERSE:For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
VERSE:And of the fields of Gomorrah:
VERSE:Their grapes are grapes of gall,
VERSE:Their clusters are bitter:
LABEL:33
VERSE:Their wine is the poison of dragons,
VERSE:And the cruel venom of asps.
LABEL:34
VERSE:  Is not this laid up in store with me,
VERSE:And sealed up among my treasures?
LABEL:35
VERSE:To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence;
VERSE:Their foot shall slide in due time:
VERSE:For the day of their calamity is at hand,
VERSE:And the things that shall come upon them make haste.
LABEL:36
VERSE:For the LORD shall judge his people,
VERSE:And repent himself for his servants,
VERSE:When he seeth that their power is gone,
VERSE:And there is none shut up, or left.
LABEL:37
VERSE:And he shall say, Where are their gods,
VERSE:Their rock in whom they trusted,
LABEL:38
VERSE:Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
VERSE:And drank the wine of their drink offerings?
VERSE:Let them rise up and help you,
VERSE:And be your protection.
LABEL:39
VERSE:See now that I, even I, am he,
VERSE:And there is no god with me:
VERSE:I kill, and I make alive;
VERSE:I wound, and I heal:
VERSE:Neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
LABEL:40
VERSE:For I lift up my hand to heaven,
VERSE:And say, I live for ever.
LABEL:41
VERSE:If I whet my glittering sword,
VERSE:And mine hand take hold on judgment;
VERSE:I will render vengeance to mine enemies,
VERSE:And will reward them that hate me.
LABEL:42
VERSE:I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
VERSE:And my sword shall devour flesh;
VERSE:And that with the blood of the slain and of the captives,
VERSE:From the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
LABEL:43
VERSE:Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people:
VERSE:For he will avenge the blood of his servants,
VERSE:And will render vengeance to his adversaries,
VERSE:And will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.
LABEL:44
VERSE:And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
LABEL:45
VERSE:And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
LABEL:46
VERSE:and he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
LABEL:47
VERSE:For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
LABEL:48
VERSE:And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
LABEL:49
VERSE:Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
LABEL:50
VERSE:and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
LABEL:51
VERSE:because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
LABEL:52
VERSE:Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
