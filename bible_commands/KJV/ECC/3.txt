VERSE:a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;

LABEL:9
VERSE:What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
LABEL:10
VERSE:I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
LABEL:11
VERSE:He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
LABEL:12
VERSE:I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
LABEL:13
VERSE:And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.
LABEL:14
VERSE:I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.
LABEL:15
VERSE:That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
LABEL:16
VERSE:And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
LABEL:17
VERSE:I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
LABEL:18
VERSE:I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
LABEL:19
VERSE:For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.
LABEL:20
VERSE:All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
LABEL:21
VERSE:Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
LABEL:22
VERSE:Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
