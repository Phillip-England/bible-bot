LABEL:19
VERSE:Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.

VERSE:And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

VERSE:which being interpreted is, God with us.
