TITLE:Jonah 2
LABEL:1
VERSE:Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
LABEL:2
VERSE:and said,
VERSE:I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
VERSE:And he heard me;
VERSE:Out of the belly of hell cried I,
VERSE:And thou heardest my voice.
LABEL:3
VERSE:For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas;
VERSE:And the floods compassed me about:
VERSE:All thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight;
VERSE:Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
LABEL:5
VERSE:The waters compassed me about, even to the soul:
VERSE:The depth closed me round about,
VERSE:The weeds were wrapped about my head.
LABEL:6
VERSE:I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
VERSE:The earth with her bars was about me for ever:
VERSE:Yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
LABEL:7
VERSE:When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD:
VERSE:And my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
LABEL:8
VERSE:They that observe lying vanities
VERSE:Forsake their own mercy.

VERSE:But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
VERSE:I will pay that that I have vowed.
VERSE:Salvation is of the LORD.
LABEL:10
VERSE:And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
