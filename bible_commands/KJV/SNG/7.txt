TITLE:Song of Solomon 7
LABEL:1
VERSE:How beautiful are thy feet with shoes,
VERSE:O prince's daughter!
VERSE:The joints of thy thighs are like jewels,
VERSE:The work of the hands of a cunning workman.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thy navel is like a round goblet,
VERSE:Which wanteth not liquor:
VERSE:Thy belly is like an heap of wheat
VERSE:Set about with lilies.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thy two breasts are like two young roes
VERSE:That are twins.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy neck is as a tower of ivory;
VERSE:Thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon,
VERSE:By the gate of Bathrabbim:
VERSE:Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon
VERSE:Which looketh toward Damascus.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thine head upon thee is like Carmel,
VERSE:And the hair of thine head like purple;
VERSE:The king is held in the galleries.
LABEL:6
VERSE:How fair and how pleasant art thou,
VERSE:O love, for delights!
LABEL:7
VERSE:This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
VERSE:And thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
LABEL:8
VERSE:I said, I will go up to the palm tree,
VERSE:I will take hold of the boughs thereof:
VERSE:Now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,
VERSE:And the smell of thy nose like apples;
LABEL:9
VERSE:And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine
VERSE:For my beloved, that goeth down sweetly,
VERSE:Causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I am my beloved's,
VERSE:And his desire is toward me.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Come, my beloved,
VERSE:Let us go forth into the field;
VERSE:Let us lodge in the villages.
LABEL:12
VERSE:Let us get up early to the vineyards;
VERSE:Let us see if the vine flourish,
VERSE:Whether the tender grape appear,
VERSE:And the pomegranates bud forth:
VERSE:There will I give thee my loves.
LABEL:13
VERSE:The mandrakes give a smell,
VERSE:And at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits,
VERSE:New and old,
VERSE:Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
