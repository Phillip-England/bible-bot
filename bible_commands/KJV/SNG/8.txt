CHAPTER:8
TITLE:Song of Solomon 8
LABEL:1
VERSE:O that thou wert as my brother,
VERSE:That sucked the breasts of my mother!
VERSE:When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
VERSE:Yea, I should not be despised.
LABEL:2
VERSE:I would lead thee,
VERSE:And bring thee into my mother's house,
VERSE:Who would instruct me:
VERSE:I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine
VERSE:Of the juice of my pomegranate.
LABEL:3
VERSE:His left hand should be under my head,
VERSE:And his right hand should embrace me.
LABEL:4
VERSE:I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
VERSE:That ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
VERSE:Until he please.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,
VERSE:Leaning upon her beloved?
VERSE:I raised thee up under the apple tree:
VERSE:There thy mother brought thee forth:
VERSE:There she brought thee forth that bare thee.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
VERSE:As a seal upon thine arm:
VERSE:For love is strong as death;
VERSE:Jealousy is cruel as the grave:
VERSE:The coals thereof are coals of fire,
VERSE:Which hath a most vehement flame.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Many waters cannot quench love,
VERSE:Neither can the floods drown it:
VERSE:If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
VERSE:It would utterly be contemned.
LABEL:8
VERSE:We have a little sister,
VERSE:And she hath no breasts:
VERSE:What shall we do for our sister
VERSE:In the day when she shall be spoken for?
LABEL:9
VERSE:If she be a wall,
VERSE:We will build upon her a palace of silver:
VERSE:And if she be a door,
VERSE:We will inclose her with boards of cedar.
LABEL:10
VERSE:I am a wall,
VERSE:And my breasts like towers:
VERSE:Then was I in his eyes
VERSE:As one that found favour.
LABEL:11
VERSE:Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon;
VERSE:He let out the vineyard unto keepers;
VERSE:Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
LABEL:12
VERSE:My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
VERSE:Thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand,
VERSE:And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
VERSE:The companions hearken to thy voice:
VERSE:Cause me to hear it.
LABEL:14
VERSE:Make haste, my beloved,
VERSE:And be thou like to a roe
VERSE:Or to a young hart
VERSE:Upon the mountains of spices.
