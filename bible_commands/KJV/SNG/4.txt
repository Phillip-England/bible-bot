CHAPTER:4
TITLE:Song of Solomon 4
LABEL:1
VERSE:Behold, thou art fair, my love;
VERSE:Behold, thou art fair;
VERSE:Thou hast doves' eyes
VERSE:Within thy locks:
VERSE:Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
VERSE:That appear from mount Gilead.
LABEL:2
VERSE:Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn,
VERSE:Which came up from the washing;
VERSE:Whereof every one bear twins,
VERSE:And none is barren among them.
LABEL:3
VERSE:Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,
VERSE:And thy speech is comely:
VERSE:Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
VERSE:Within thy locks.
LABEL:4
VERSE:Thy neck is like the tower of David
VERSE:Builded for an armoury,
VERSE:Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
VERSE:All shields of mighty men.
LABEL:5
VERSE:Thy two breasts are like two young roes
VERSE:That are twins,
VERSE:Which feed among the lilies.
LABEL:6
VERSE:Until the day break,
VERSE:And the shadows flee away,
VERSE:I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,
VERSE:And to the hill of frankincense.
LABEL:7
VERSE:Thou art all fair, my love;
VERSE:There is no spot in thee.
LABEL:8
VERSE:Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse,
VERSE:With me from Lebanon:
VERSE:Look from the top of Amana,
VERSE:From the top of Shenir and Hermon,
VERSE:From the lions' dens,
VERSE:From the mountains of the leopards.
LABEL:9
VERSE:Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse;
VERSE:Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
VERSE:With one chain of thy neck.
LABEL:10
VERSE:How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse!
VERSE:How much better is thy love than wine!
VERSE:And the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
LABEL:11
VERSE:Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb:
VERSE:Honey and milk are under thy tongue;
VERSE:And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
LABEL:12
VERSE:A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse;
VERSE:A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
LABEL:13
VERSE:Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates,
VERSE:With pleasant fruits;
VERSE:Camphire, with spikenard,
LABEL:14
VERSE:Spikenard and saffron;
VERSE:Calamus and cinnamon,
VERSE:With all trees of frankincense;
VERSE:Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
LABEL:15
VERSE:A fountain of gardens,
VERSE:A well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
LABEL:16
VERSE:Awake, O north wind;
VERSE:And come, thou south;
VERSE:Blow upon my garden,
VERSE:That the spices thereof may flow out.
VERSE:Let my beloved come into his garden,
VERSE:And eat his pleasant fruits.
