The person who lives in right relationship with God does it by embracing what God arranges for him. Doing things for God is the opposite of entering into what God does for you. Habakkuk had it right: “The person who believes God, is set right by God—and that’s the real life.” Rule-keeping does not naturally evolve into living by faith, but only perpetuates itself in more and more rule-keeping, a fact observed in Scripture: “The one who does these things [rule-keeping] continues to live by them.”</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="GAL.3.11+GAL.3.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="GAL.3.13+GAL.3.14" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">13-14</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Christ redeemed us from that self-defeating, cursed life by absorbing it completely into himself. Do you remember the Scripture that says, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”? That is what happened when Jesus was nailed to the cross: He became a curse, and at the same time dissolved the curse. And now, because of that, the air is cleared and we can see that Abraham’s blessing is present and available for non-Jews, too. We are </span><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">all</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> able to receive God’s life, his Spirit, in and with us by believing—just the way Abraham received it.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_pc__SFTa7"><span data-usfm="GAL.3.13+GAL.3.14" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">* * *</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="GAL.3.13+GAL.3.14" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="GAL.3.15+GAL.3.16+GAL.3.17+GAL.3.18" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">15-18a</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Friends, let me give you an example from everyday affairs of the free life I am talking about. Once a person’s will has been signed, no one else can annul it or add to it. Now, the promises were made to Abraham and to his descendant. You will observe that Scripture, in the careful language of a legal document, does not say “to descendants,” referring to everybody in general, but “to your descendant” (the noun, note, is singular), referring to Christ. This is the way I interpret this: A will, earlier signed by God, is not annulled by an addendum attached 430 years later, thereby negating the promise of the will. No, this addendum, with its instructions and regulations, has nothing to do with the promised inheritance in the will.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="GAL.3.15+GAL.3.16+GAL.3.17+GAL.3.18" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="GAL.3.18+GAL.3.19+GAL.3.20" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">18b-20</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> What is the point, then, of the law, the attached addendum? It was a thoughtful addition to the original covenant promises made to Abraham. The purpose of the law was to keep a sinful people in the way of salvation until Christ (the descendant) came, inheriting the promises and distributing them to us. Obviously this law was not a firsthand encounter with God. It was arranged by angelic messengers through a middleman, Moses. But if there is a middleman as there was at Sinai, then the people are not dealing directly with God, are they? But the original promise is the </span><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">direct</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> blessing of God, received by faith.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="GAL.3.18+GAL.3.19+GAL.3.20" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="GAL.3.21+GAL.3.22" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">21-22</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">If such is the case, is the law, then, an anti-promise, a negation of God’s will for us? Not at all. Its purpose was to make obvious to everyone that we are, in ourselves, out of right relationship with God, and therefore to show us the futility of devising some religious system for getting by our own efforts what we can only get by waiting in faith for God to complete his promise. For if any kind of rule-keeping had power to create life in us, we would certainly have gotten it by this time.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="GAL.3.21+GAL.3.22" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="GAL.3.23+GAL.3.24" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">23-24</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Until the time when we were mature enough to respond freely in faith to the living God, we were carefully surrounded and protected by the Mosaic law.
