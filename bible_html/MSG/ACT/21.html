We made a straight run to Cos, the next day reached Rhodes, and then Patara. There we found a ship going direct to Phoenicia, got on board, and set sail. Cyprus came into view on our left, but was soon out of sight as we kept on course for Syria, and eventually docked in the port of Tyre. While the cargo was being unloaded, we looked up the local disciples and stayed with them seven days. Their message to Paul, from insight given by the Spirit, was “Don’t go to Jerusalem.”</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="ACT.21.1+ACT.21.2+ACT.21.3+ACT.21.4" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="ACT.21.5+ACT.21.6" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">5-6</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">When our time was up, they escorted us out of the city to the docks.
