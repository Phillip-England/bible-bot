Paul went to their meeting place, as he usually did when he came to a town, and for three Sabbaths running he preached to them from the Scriptures. He opened up the texts so they understood what they’d been reading all their lives: that the Messiah absolutely </span><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">had</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> to be put to death and raised from the dead—there were no other options—and that “this Jesus I’m introducing you to is that Messiah.”</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="ACT.17.1+ACT.17.2+ACT.17.3" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="ACT.17.4+ACT.17.5" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">4-5a</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Some of them were won over and joined ranks with Paul and Silas, among them a great many God-fearing Greeks and a considerable number of women from the aristocracy. But the hard-line Jews became furious over the conversions. Mad with jealousy, they rounded up a bunch of brawlers off the streets and soon had an ugly mob terrorizing the city as they hunted down Paul and Silas.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="ACT.17.4+ACT.17.5" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="ACT.17.5+ACT.17.6+ACT.17.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">5b-7</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> They broke into Jason’s house, thinking that Paul and Silas were there. When they couldn’t find them, they collared Jason and his friends instead and dragged them before the city fathers, yelling hysterically, “These people are out to destroy the world, and now they’ve shown up on our doorstep, attacking everything we hold dear!

They sent them to Berea, where they again met with the Jewish community. They were treated a lot better there than in Thessalonica. The Jews received Paul’s message with enthusiasm and met with him daily, examining the Scriptures to see if they supported what he said. A lot of them became believers, including many Greeks who were prominent in the community, women and men of influence.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="ACT.17.10+ACT.17.11+ACT.17.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="ACT.17.13+ACT.17.14+ACT.17.15" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">13-15</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">But it wasn’t long before reports got back to the Thessalonian hard-line Jews that Paul was at it again, preaching the Word of God, this time in Berea. They lost no time responding, and created a mob scene there, too. With the help of his friends, Paul gave them the slip—caught a boat and put out to sea. Silas and Timothy stayed behind. The men who helped Paul escape got him as far as Athens and left him there. Paul sent word back with them to Silas and Timothy: “Come as quickly as you can!”</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">Athens</span></div><div class="ChapterContent_m__3AINJ"><span data-usfm="ACT.17.13+ACT.17.14+ACT.17.15" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="ACT.17.16" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">16</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">The longer Paul waited in Athens for Silas and Timothy, the angrier he got—all those idols!

And every day he went out on the streets and talked with anyone who happened along. He got to know some of the Epicurean and Stoic intellectuals pretty well through these conversations. Some of them dismissed him with sarcasm: “What a moron!” But others, listening to him go on about Jesus and the resurrection, were intrigued: “That’s a new slant on the gods. Tell us more.”</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="ACT.17.17+ACT.17.18" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="ACT.17.19+ACT.17.20+ACT.17.21" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">19-21</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">These people got together and asked him to make a public presentation over at the Areopagus, where things were a little quieter. They said, “This is a new one on us. We’ve never heard anything quite like it. Where did you come up with this anyway? Explain it so we can understand.” Downtown Athens was a great place for gossip. There were always people hanging around, natives and tourists alike, waiting for the latest tidbit on most anything.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="ACT.17.19+ACT.17.20+ACT.17.21" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="ACT.17.22+ACT.17.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">22-23</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">So Paul took his stand in the open space at the Areopagus and laid it out for them. “It is plain to see that you Athenians take your religion seriously. When I arrived here the other day, I was fascinated with all the shrines I came across. And then I found one inscribed, </span><span class="ChapterContent_nd__ECPAf"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">to the god nobody knows</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">.

There were still others, it turned out, who were convinced then and there, and stuck with Paul—among them Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris.</span></span></div>
