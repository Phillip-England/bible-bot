If you became believers because you trusted the proclamation that Christ is alive, risen from the dead, how can you let people say that there is no such thing as a resurrection? If there’s no resurrection, there’s no living Christ. And face it—if there’s no resurrection for Christ, everything we’ve told you is smoke and mirrors, and everything you’ve staked your life on is smoke and mirrors. Not only that, but we would be guilty of telling a string of barefaced lies about God, all these affidavits we passed on to you verifying that God raised up Christ—sheer fabrications, if there’s no resurrection.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="1CO.15.12+1CO.15.13+1CO.15.14+1CO.15.15" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="1CO.15.16+1CO.15.17+1CO.15.18+1CO.15.19+1CO.15.20" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">16-20</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">If corpses can’t be raised, then Christ wasn’t, because he was indeed dead.

But we have to wait our turn: Christ is first, then those with him at his Coming, the grand consummation when, after crushing the opposition, he hands over his kingdom to God the Father. He won’t let up until the last enemy is down—and the very last enemy is death! As the psalmist said, “He laid them low, one and all; he walked all over them.” When Scripture says that “he walked all over them,” it’s obvious that he couldn’t at the same time be walked on.
