The NIV supplies a verb (“searches”) from the second half of the verse, changing the emphasis somewhat.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> of the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord,</span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="PRO.20.27" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">searching all his innermost parts.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “all the chambers of the belly.” This means “the inner parts of the body” (BDB 293 s.v. חֶדֶר); cf.
