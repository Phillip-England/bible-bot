The people are getting ready to meet with God, receive the Law from him, and enter into a covenant with him. All of this required mediation and preparation. Through it all, Israel will become God’s unique possession, a kingdom of priests on earth – if they comply with his Law. The chapter can be divided as follows: vv. 1-8 tell how God, Israel’s great deliverer promised to make them a kingdom of priests; this is followed by God’s declaration that Moses would be the mediator (v. 9); vv. 10-22 record instructions for Israel to prepare themselves to worship Yahweh and an account of the manifestation of Yahweh with all the phenomena; and the chapter closes with the mediation of Moses on behalf of the people (vv. 23-25). Having been redeemed from Egypt, the people will now be granted a covenant with God. See also R. E.

W. C. Kaiser (“Exodus,” EBC 2:417) offers four possible renderings of the expression: 1) apposition, viz., “kings, that is, priests; 2) as a construct with a genitive of specification, “royal priesthood”; 3) as a construct with the genitive being the attribute, “priestly kingdom”; and 4) reading with an unexpressed “and” – “kings and priests.” He takes the latter view that they were to be kings and priests. (Other references are R. B. Y. Scott, “A Kingdom of Priests (Exodus xix. 6),” OTS 8 [1950]: 213-19; William L. Moran, “A Kingdom of Priests,” The Bible in Current Catholic Thought, 7-20). However, due to the parallelism of the next description which uses an adjective, this is probably a construct relationship. This kingdom of God will be composed of a priestly people. All the Israelites would be living wholly in God’s service and enjoying the right of access to him. And, as priests, they would have the duty of representing God to the nations, following what they perceived to be the duties of priests – proclaiming God’s word, interceding for people, and making provision for people to find God through atonement (see Deut 33:9,10).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> and a holy nation.’</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn They are also to be “a holy nation.” They are to be a nation separate and distinct from the rest of the nations. Here is another aspect of their duty. It was one thing to be God’s special possession, but to be that they had to be priestly and holy. The duties of the covenant will specify what it would mean to be a holy nation. In short, they had to keep themselves free from everything that characterized pagan people (S. R. Driver, Exodus, 171). So it is a bilateral covenant: they received special privileges but they must provide special services by the special discipline. See also H. Kruse, “Exodus 19:5 and the Mission of Israel,” North East Asian Journal of Theology 24/25 (1980): 239-42.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> These are the words that you will speak to the Israelites.”</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="EXO.19.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">7</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> So Moses came and summoned the elders of Israel.

In this context it would be natural to say that the repeated thunderings were the voice of God – but how is that an answer? Deut 4:12 says that the people heard the sound of words. U. Cassuto (Exodus, 232-33) rightly comments, “He was answering him with a loud voice so that it was possible for Moses to hear His words clearly in the midst of the storm.” He then draws a parallel from Ugaritic where it tells that one of the gods was speaking in a loud voice.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="EXO.19.20" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">20</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> came down on Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain, and the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. </span></span><span data-usfm="EXO.19.21" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">21</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> said to Moses, “Go down and solemnly warn</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn The imperative הָעֵד (ha’ed) means “charge” them – put them under oath, or solemnly warn them.

It could serve for meditation: the theology drawn from the three parts could be subordinated to the theme of holiness: God is holy, therefore adhere to his word for service, approach him through a mediator, and adore him in purity and fearful reverence. A developed outline for the exposition could be: I. If the people of God will obey him, they will be privileged to serve in a unique way (1-8); II. If the people of God are to obey, they must be convinced of the divine source of their commands (9); and finally, III. If the people of God are convinced of the divine approval of their mediator, and the divine source of their instructions, they must sanctify themselves before him (vv. 10-25). In sum, the manifestation of the holiness of Yahweh is the reason for sanctification and worship. The correlation is to be made through 1 Peter 2 to the church. The Church is a kingdom of priests; it is to obey the Word of God. What is the motivation for this? Their mediator is Jesus Christ; he has the approval of the Father and manifests the glory of God to his own; and he declares the purpose of their calling is to display his glory. God’s people are to abstain from sin so that pagans can see their good works and glorify God.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span></div>
