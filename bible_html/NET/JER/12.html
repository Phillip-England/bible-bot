Here the parallelism argues that it refers to the nation of Judah. The translation throughout vv. 5-17 assumes that the verb forms are prophetic perfects, the form that conceives of the action as being as good as done. It is possible that the forms are true perfects and refer to a past destruction of Judah. If so, it may have been connected with the assaults against Judah in 598/7 b.c. by the Babylonians and the nations surrounding Judah recorded in 2 Kgs 24:14. No other major recent English version reflects these as prophetic perfects besides NIV and NCV, which does not use the future until v. 10. Hence the translation is somewhat tentative. C. Feinberg, “Jeremiah,” EBC 6:459 takes them as prophetic perfects and H. Freedman (Jeremiah [SoBB], 88) mentions that as a possibility for explaining the presence of this passage here. For another example of an extended use of the prophetic perfect without imperfects interspersed see Isa 8:23-9:6. The translation assumes they are prophetic and are part of the Lord’s answer to the complaint about the prosperity of the wicked; both the wicked Judeans and the wicked nations God will use to punish them will be punished.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will forsake the people I call my own.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “my inheritance.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will turn my beloved people</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the beloved of my soul.” Here “soul” stands for the person and is equivalent to “my.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">over to the power</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “will give…into the hands of.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> of their enemies.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.8" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">8</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The people I call my own</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn See the note on the previous verse.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> have turned on me</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.8" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">like a lion</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “have become to me like a lion.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> in the forest.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.8" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">They have roared defiantly</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “have given against me with her voice.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> at me.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.8" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">So I will treat them as though I hate them.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Or “so I will reject her.” The word “hate” is sometimes used in a figurative way to refer to being neglected, i.e., treated as though unloved.

In the Hebrew text sentence is a question: “Is not my inheritance to me a bird of prey [or] a hyena/a speckled bird of prey?” The question expects a positive answer and so is rendered here as an affirmative statement. The meaning of the word “speckled” is debated. It occurs only here. BDB 840 s.v. צָבוּעַ relates it to another word that occurs only once in Judg 5:30 which is translated “dyed stuff.” HALOT 936 s.v. צָבוּעַ relates a word found in the cognates meaning “hyena.” This is more likely and is the interpretation followed by the Greek which reads the first two words as “cave of hyena.” This translation has led some scholars to posit a homonym for the word “bird of prey” meaning “cave” which is based on Arabic parallels. The metaphor would then be of Israel carried off by hyenas and surrounded by birds of prey. The evidence for the meaning “cave” is weak and would involve a wordplay of a rare homonym with another word that is better known. For a discussion of the issues see J. Barr, Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament, 128-29, 153.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.9" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">But other birds of prey are all around them.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Are birds of prey around her?” The question is again rhetorical and expects a positive answer. The birds of prey are of course the hostile nations surrounding her. The metaphor involved in these two lines may be interpreted differently. I.e., God considers Israel a proud bird of prey (hence the word for speckled) but one who is surrounded and under attack by other birds of prey. The fact that the sentences are divided into two rhetorical questions speaks somewhat against this.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.9" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Let all the nations gather together like wild beasts.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.9" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Let them come and destroy these people I call my own.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Go, gather all the beasts of the field [= wild beasts].

Since translating literally would raise question about who the commands are addressed to, they have been turned into passive third person commands to avoid confusion. The metaphor has likewise been turned into a simile to help the modern reader. By the way, the imperatives here implying future action argue that the passage is future and that it is correct to take the verb forms as prophetic perfects.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.10" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">10</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Many foreign rulers</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Many shepherds.” For the use of the term “shepherd” as a figure for rulers see the notes on 10:21.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> will ruin the land where I planted my people.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “my vineyard.” To translate literally would presuppose an unlikely familiarity of this figure on the part of some readers.

Part of this is reflected in the translation. The same Hebrew word referring to a desolation or a waste (שְׁמֵמָה, shÿmemah) is repeated three times at the end of three successive lines and the related verb is found at the beginning of the fourth (נָשַׁמָּה, nashammah). A similar sounding word is found in the second of the three successive lines (שָׁמָהּ, shamah = “he [they] will make it”). This latter word is part of a further play because it is repeated in a different form in the last line (שָׁם, sham = “laying”); they lay it waste but no one lays it to heart. There is also an interesting contrast between the sorrow the Lord feels and the inattention of the people.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">12</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> A destructive army</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “destroyers.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> will come marching</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">over the hilltops in the desert.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">For the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> will use them as his destructive weapon</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “It is the Lord’s consuming sword.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.12.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">against</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “For a sword of the Lord will devour.” The sword is often symbolic for destructive forces of all kinds.

However, this is the easier reading and is not supported by either the Latin or the Greek which have second plural. This is probably another case of the shift from description to direct address that has been met with several times already in Jeremiah (the figure of speech called apostrophe; for other examples see, e.g., 9:4; 11:13).
