Ammon was a small kingdom to the north and east of Moab which was in constant conflict with the Transjordanian tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh over territorial rights to the lands north and south of the Jabbok River. Ammon mainly centered on the city of Rabbah which is modern Amman. According to Judg 11:13 the Ammonites claimed the land between the Jabbok and the Arnon but this was land taken from them by Sihon and Og and land that the Israelites captured from the latter two kings. The Ammonites attempted to expand into the territory of Israel in the Transjordan in the time of Jephthah (Judg 10-11) and the time of Saul (1 Sam 11). Apparently when Tiglath Pileser carried away the Israelite tribes in Transjordan in 733 b.c., the Ammonites took over possession of their cities (Jer 49:1). Like Moab they appear to have been loyal to Nebuchadnezzar in the early part of his reign, forming part of the contingent that he sent to harass Judah when Jehoiakim rebelled in 598 b.c. (2 Kgs 24:2). But along with Moab and Edom they sent representatives to plot rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 b.c. (Jer 27:3). The Ammonites were evidently in rebellion against him in 588 b.c. when he had to decide whether to attack Rabbah or Jerusalem first (Ezek 21:18-23 [21:23-28 HT]). They appear to have remained in rebellion after the destruction of Jerusalem because their king Baalis was behind the plot to assassinate Gedaliah and offered refuge to Ishmael after he did it (Jer 40:13; 41:15). According to the Jewish historian Josephus they were conquered in 582 b.c. by Nebuchadnezzar.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.1" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">“Do you think there are not any people of the nation of Israel remaining?</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.1" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Do you think there are not any of them remaining to reinherit their land?</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.1" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Is that why you people who worship the god Milcom</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tc The reading here and in v. 3 follows the reading of the Greek, Syriac, and Latin versions and 1 Kgs 11:5, 33; 2 Kgs 23:13.

Hence the meaning that is generally agreed on is reflected in an admittedly paraphrastic translation. The reference is to the fact that the Ammonites had taken possession of the cities that had been deserted when the Assyrians carried off the Transjordanian tribes in 733 b.c. assuming that the Israelites would not return in sufficient numbers to regain control of it. The thought underlying the expression “Why has Milcom taken possession…” reflects the idea, common in the OT and the ancient Near East, that the god of a people drove out the previous inhabitants, gave their land to his worshipers to possess, and took up residence with them there (cf., e.g., Deut 1:21; Judg 11:24 and line 33-34 of the Moabite stone: “Chemosh said to me, ‘Go down, fight against Hauronen.’ And I went down [and I fought against the town and took it], and Chemosh dwelt there in my time.” [ANET 321]).</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">2</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Because you did that, </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I, the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">, affirm that</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “oracle of the Lord.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> a time is coming</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">when I will make Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon,</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">hear the sound of the battle cry.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">It will become a mound covered with ruins.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a desolate tel.” For the explanation of what a “tel” is see the study note on 30:18.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Its villages will be burned to the ground.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Its daughters will be burned with fire.” For the use of the word “daughters” to refer to the villages surrounding a larger city see BDB 123 s.v.

The Hebrew text reads “run back and forth among the walls.” The word “run back and forth” is generally taken as a Hitpolel of a verb that means to “go about” in the Qal and to “go back and forth” in the Polel (cf. BDB 1002 s.v. I שׁוּט). The noun that follows in the Hebrew means “wall, hedge” and is quite commonly modified by the noun צֹאן (tso’n, “sheep”) referring to sheepfolds (cf., e.g., Num 32:36; 1 Sam 24:3). But the phrase “run back and forth among the sheepfolds” yields little meaning here. In Ps 89:40 (89:41 HT) the word “wall” is used in parallelism with fortified cities and refers to the walls of the city. That is the sense that is assumed in one of the alternate translations with the words “of your towns” being supplied in the translation for clarification. However, that figure is a little odd in a context which speaks of mourning rites. Hence, some emend the word “walls” (גְּדֵרוֹת, gÿderot) to “gashes” (גְּדֻדוֹת, gÿdudot), a word that has occurred in a similar context in Jer 48:37. That would involve only the common confusion of ר and ד. That is the reading adopted here and fits the context nicely. NRSV appears to go one step further and read the verb as a Hitpolel from a root that is otherwise used only as a noun to mean “whip” or “scourge.” NRSV reads “slash yourselves with whips” which also makes excellent sense in the context but is not supported by any parallel use of the verb.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.3" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">For your god Milcom will go into exile</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.3" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">along with his priests and officials.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn Compare Jer 48:7 and the study note there.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.4" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">4</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Why do you brag about your great power?</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.4" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Your power is ebbing away,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Or “Why do you brag about your valleys, about the fruitfulness of your valleys.” The meaning of the first two lines of this verse are uncertain primarily due to the ambiguity of the expression זָב עִמְקֵךְ (zav ’imqekh). The form זָב (zav) is either a Qal perfect or Qal participle of a verb meaning flow. It is common in the expression “a land flowing with milk and honey” and is also common to refer to the seminal discharge or discharge of blood which makes a man or woman unclean. BDB 264 s.v. זוּב Qal.2 sees it as an abbreviation of the idea of “flowing with milk and honey” and sees it as referring to the fertility of Ammon’s valley. However, there are no other examples of such an ellipsis. Several of the modern English versions and commentaries have taken the word עֵמֶק (’emeq) not as a reference to a valley but to the homonym cited in the note on 47:5 and see the reference here to the flowing away of Ammon’s strength. That interpretation is followed here. Instead of explaining the plural ending on עֲמָקִים (’amaqim) as being an enclitic ם (mem) as others who follow this interpretation (e.g., J. Bright, Jeremiah [AB], 325), the present translation understands the plural as a plural of amplification (cf. GKC 397-98 §124.e and compare the noun “might” in Isa 40:26).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> you rebellious people of Ammon,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “apostate daughter.” This same term is applied to Israel in Jer 31:22 but seems inappropriate here to Ammon because she had never been loyal to the Lord and could not hence be called “apostate.” However, if it is used of the fact that she rebelled against the Lord’s servant, Nebuchadnezzar, it might be appropriate (cf. Jer 27:6, 8). Hence the term “rebellious” is used in the translation to represent it. The word “daughter” is again a personification of the land (cf. BDB 123 s.v. בַּת 3) and is here translated “people of Ammon” to make it easier for the modern reader to identify the referent.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.4" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">who trust in your riches and say,</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.4" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">‘Who would dare to attack us?’</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.5" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">5</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> I will bring terror on you from every side,”</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.5" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">says the Lord </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">God</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> who rules over all.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “The Lord Yahweh of armies.” For an explanation of the rendering here and of the significance of this title see the study note on 2:19.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.5" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">“You will be scattered in every direction.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “You will be scattered each man [straight] before him.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.5" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">No one will gather the fugitives back together.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.6" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">6</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Yet in days to come </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.6" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will reverse Ammon’s ill fortune.”</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn See Jer 29:14; 30:3 and the translator’s note on 29:14 for the idiom used here.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.6" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">says the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Oracle of the Lord.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">Judgment Against Edom</span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">7</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> who rules over all</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Yahweh of armies.” See the study note on 2:19 for this title.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> spoke about Edom.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn Edom was a kingdom to the south and east of Judah.

A long history of hostility existed between Israel and Edom, making Edom one of the favorite objects of the prophets’ oracles of judgment (cf., e.g., Isa 21:11-12; 34:5-15; 63:1-6; Amos 1:11-12; Ezek 25:12-14; 35:1-15; Obad 1-16). Not much is known about Edom at this time other than the fact that they participated in the discussions regarding rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 b.c.

The perfect must be some kind of a future perfect; “would they not have destroyed only…” The negative question is carried over by ellipsis from the preceding lines.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.10" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">10</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> But I will strip everything away from Esau’s descendants.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.10" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will uncover their hiding places so they cannot hide.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.10" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Their children, relatives, and neighbors will all be destroyed.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.10" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Not one of them will be left!</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.11" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">11</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Leave your orphans behind and I will keep them alive.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.11" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Your widows too can depend on me.”</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Or “Their children and relatives will all be destroyed.

Bright, J. A. Thompson, W. L. Holladay, and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers). However, the majority of modern English versions do not follow it and lacking any other Hebrew or versional evidence it is probable that this is an interpretation to explain the mitigation of what appears as a prophecy of utter annihilation. There have been other cases in Jeremiah where a universal affirmation (either positive or negative) has been modified in the verses that follow. The verb in the second line תִּבְטָחוּ (tivtakhu) is highly unusual; it is a second masculine plural form with a feminine plural subject. The form is explained in GKC 127-28 §47.k and 160-61 §60.a, n. 1 as a pausal substitution for the normal form תִּבְטַחְנָה (tivtakhnah) and a similar form in Ezek 37:7 cited as a parallel.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">12</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> For the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> says, “If even those who did not deserve to drink from the cup of my wrath must drink from it, do you think you will go unpunished?

Contingents from these Aramean states were involved in harassing Judah and Jerusalem in 598 b.c. when Jehoiakim rebelled (2 Kgs 24:2) but little is heard about them in the rest of the book of Jeremiah or in the history of this period.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">“The people of Hamath and Arpad</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Hamath and Arpad.” There is no word for people in the text. The cities are being personified. However, since it is really the people who are involved and it is clearer for the modern reader, the present translation supplies the words “people of” both here and in v. 24. The verbs in vv. 23-25 are all to be interpreted as prophetic perfects, the tense of the Hebrew verb that views an action as though it were as good as done. The verbs are clearly future in vv. 26-27 which begin with a “therefore.”sn Hamath was a city on the Orontes River about 110 miles (183 km) north of Damascus. Arpad was a city that was 95 miles (158 km) farther north from there. These two cities were in the path of the northern descent of the kings of Assyria and Babylonia and had been conquered earlier under the Assyrian kings (Isa 10:9; 36:19; 37:13). The apparent reference here is to their terror and loss of courage when they hear the news that Nebuchadnezzar’s armies are on the move toward them and Damascus. They would have been in the path of Nebuchadnezzar as he chased Necho south after the battle of Carchemish.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> will be dismayed</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">because they have heard bad news.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Their courage will melt away because of worry.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Their hearts will not be able to rest.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tc The meaning of this verse is very uncertain. The Hebrew text apparently reads “Hamath and Arpad are dismayed. They melt away because they have heard bad news. Anxiety is in the sea; it [the sea] cannot be quiet.” Many commentaries and English versions redivide the verse and read “like the sea” for “in the sea” (כַּיָּם [kayyam] for בַּיָּם [bayyam]) and read the feminine singular noun דְּאָגָה (dÿ’agam) as though it were the third masculine plural verb דָּאֲגוּ (da’agu): “They are troubled like the sea.” The translation follows the emendation proposed in BHS and accepted by a number of commentaries (e.g., J. Bright, Jeremiah [AB], 333; J. A. Thompson, Jeremiah [NICOT], 723, n. 1). That emendation involves reading נָמֹג לִבָּם מִדְּאָגָה (namog libbam middÿ’agah) instead of נָמֹגוּ בַּיָּם דְּאָגָה (namogu bayyam dÿ’agah). The translation also involves a double reading of “heart,” for the sake of English style, once in the sense of courage (BDB 525 s.v. לֵב 10) because that is the nuance that best fits “melts” in the English idiom and once in the more general sense of hearts as the seat of fear, anxiety, worry. The double translation is a concession to English style.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.24" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">24</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The people of Damascus will lose heart and turn to flee.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.24" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Panic will grip them.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.24" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Pain and anguish will seize them</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.24" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">like a woman in labor.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.25" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">25</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> How deserted will that once-famous city</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “city of praise.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> be,</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.49.25" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">that city that was once filled with</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “city of joy.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> joy!</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tc Or “Why has that famous city not been abandoned, that city I once took delight in?” The translation follows the majority of modern commentaries in understanding לֹא (lo’, “not”) before “abandoned” as a misunderstanding of the emphatic ל (lamed; so J.
