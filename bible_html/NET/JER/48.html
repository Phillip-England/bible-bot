Basically, it was the tableland between the Arnon River about halfway up the Dead Sea and the Zered River which is roughly at the southern tip of the Dead Sea. When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to take any of the Moabite territory but they did capture the kingdom of Sihon north of the Arnon which Sihon had taken from Moab. Several of the towns mentioned in the oracles of judgment against Moab here are in this territory north of the Arnon and were assigned to Reuben and Gad. Several are mentioned on the famous Moabite Stone which details how Mesha king of Moab recovered from Israel many of these cities during the reign of Joram (852-841 b.c.; cf. 2 Kgs 3:4-5). It is usually assumed that Moab submitted to Nebuchadnezzar after the battle of Carchemish and that they remained loyal to him throughout most of this period, though representatives were present at Jerusalem in 594 b.c. when plans for revolt were apparently being discussed (Jer 27:3). Moabite contingents were used by Nebuchadnezzar in 598 b.c. to harass Jehoiakim after he rebelled (2 Kgs 24:2) so they must have remained loyal at that time. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Moab in 582 b.c. and destroyed many of its cities.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.1" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">“Sure to be judged is Nebo!

I צָעִיר 2 and see Gen 43:33). Many of the modern commentaries and a few of the modern English versions follow the Greek version and read “their cry is heard as far as Zoar” (reading צֹעֲרָה, tso’arah; see, for example, J. A. Thompson, Jeremiah [NICOT], 699, n. 4, and BDB 858 s.v. צֹעַר). However, that leaves the verb with an indefinite subject (the verb is active 3rd plural not passive) not otherwise identified in the preceding context. Many of the modern English versions such as NRSV, NJPS, NIV retain the Hebrew as the present translation has done.

The verb in the first two lines “climb” (יַעֲלֶה, ya’aleh) is third masculine singular and the verb in the second two lines “will hear” (שָׁמֵעוּ, shame’u) is third common plural. The causal particles at the beginning of the two halves of the verse suggest some connection with the preceding, so the translation assumes that the children are still the subject. In this case the singular verb would be a case of the distributive singular already referred to in the translator’s note on 46:15. The parallel passage in Isa 15:5 refers to the “fugitives” (בְּרִיחֶהָ, bÿrikheha) with the same singular verb as here and that may be the implied subject here.sn The location of Luhith and Horonaim are uncertain, though, from their connection with Zoar in Isa 15:5, they appear to be located in southern Moab.

The translation follows one reading of the Hebrew text. The Greek version reads “Be like a wild donkey in the desert!” There are three points of debate in this line: the syntax of the verb form “be” (תִהְיֶינָה, tihyenah) and the text and meaning of the word translated “shrub” in the Hebrew text. This word only occurs with this meaning here and in Jer 17:6. A related word occurs in Ps 102:17 (102:18 HT). Elsewhere this spelling refers to the place name Aroer which was a place in Moab on the edge of the Arnon River. Most commentators do not feel that a reference to that place is appropriate here because it was not in the desert. The Greek version reads “like a wild donkey” (reading כְּעָרוֹד [kÿ’arod] in place of כַּעֲרוֹעֵר [ka’aro’er]). That would make an appropriate simile here because the wild donkey enjoys its freedom and is hard to capture. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (Jeremiah 26-52 [WBC], 312) explain the simile of the “shrub” as referring to the marginal and rudimentary existence of a displaced person. That may not be as optimistic as the reference to the wild donkey but it does give an appropriate meaning. The third feminine plural has been explained as the singular noun + suffix = “yourselves” (נַפְשְׁכֶם, nafshÿkhem) used as a collective (so S. R. Driver, Jeremiah, 368, with cross reference to GKC 462-63 §145.c). J. Bright (Jeremiah [AB], 314, n. e-e) follows a suggestion of D. N. Freedman in seeing the form (תִהְיֶינָה, tihyenah) as a mistake for the 2nd masculine plural plus energic (תִהְיוּן, tihyun). Given the number of other textual corruptions in this passage, this is possible. The resultant meaning in either case is the same.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">7</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> “Moab, you trust in the things you do and in your riches.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">So you too will be conquered.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.7" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Your god Chemosh</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn Chemosh was the national god of Moab (see also Numb 21:29).

The Hebrew of these two lines presents several difficulties. It reads תְּנוּ־צִיץ לְמוֹאָב נָצֹא תֵּצֵא (tÿnu-tsits lÿmo’av natso’ tetse’). Of the five words two are extremely problematic and the meaning of the second affects also the meaning of the last word which normally means “go out.” The word צִיץ (tsits) regularly refers to a blossom or flower or the diadem on the front of Aaron’s mitre. BDB 851 s.v. II צִיץ gives a nuance “wings (coll)” based on the interpretation of Abu Walid and some medieval Jewish interpreters who related it to an Aramaic root. But BDB says that meaning is dubious and refers to the Greek which reads σημεῖα (shmeia, “sign” or “sign post”). Along with KBL 802 s.v. I צִיץ and HALOT 959 s.v. II צִיץ, BDB suggests that the Greek presupposes the word צִיּוּן (tsiyyun) which refers to a road marker (Jer 31:21) or a gravestone (2 Kgs 23:17). That is the meaning followed here. Several modern commentaries and English versions have followed a proposal by W. Moran that the word is related to a Ugaritic word meaning salt (cf., e.g., J. Bright, Jeremiah [AB], 320). However, HALOT 959 s.v. II צִיץ questions the validity of this on philological grounds saying that the meaning of salt does not really fit the Ugaritic either. The present translation follows the suggestions of the lexicons here and reads the word as though the Greek supported the meaning “gravestone.” The other difficulty is with the word נָצֹא (natso’), which looks like a Qal infinitive absolute of an otherwise unattested root which BDB s.v. נָצָא says is defined in Gesenius’ Thesaurus as “fly.” However, see the meaning and the construction of an infinitive absolute of one root with that of another as highly improbable. Hence, most modern lexicons either emend the forms to read נָצֹה תִּצֶּה (natsoh titseh) from the root נָצָה (natsah) meaning “to fall into ruins” (so KBL 629 s.v. נָצָה Qal, and see among others J. A. Thompson, Jeremiah [NICOT], 700, n. 10, who notes that final א [aleph] and final ה [hey] are often confused; see the discussion and examples in GKC 216-17 §75.nn-rr). This is the option that this translation as well as a number of modern ones have taken. A second option is to see נָצֹא (natso’) as an error for יָצֹא (yatso’) and read the text in the sense of “she will certainly surrender,” a meaning that the verb יָצָא (yatsa’) has in 1 Sam 11:3; Isa 36:6. The best discussion of this option as well as a discussion on the problem of reading צִיץ (tsits) as salt is found in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G.

HALOT 459 s.v. II כֵּן 2.c for the meaning “untrue” for both this passage and the parallel one in Isa 16:6). There is some difference of opinion about the identification of the “I” in this verse. Most commentators see it as referring to the prophet. However, F. B. Huey (Jeremiah, Lamentations [NAC], 395) is probably correct in seeing it as referring to the Lord. He points to the fact that the “I” in vv. 33, 35, 38 can only refer to God. The “I know” in v. 30 also clearly has the Lord as its subject. There are other cases in the book of Jeremiah where the Lord expresses his lament over the fate of a people (cf. 14:1-6, 17-18).</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.31" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">31</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> So I will weep with sorrow for Moab.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.31" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will cry out in sadness for all of Moab.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.31" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will moan</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tc The translation is based on the emendation of the Hebrew third masculine singular (יֶהְגֶּה, yehggeh) to the first singular (אֶהְגֶּה, ’ehgeh).

The verse is actually in the second person, an apostrophe or direct address to the grapevine(s) of Sibmah. However, the translation has retained the third person throughout because such sudden shifts in person are uncommon in contemporary English literature and retaining the third person is smoother. The Hebrew text reads: “From/With the weeping of Jazer I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah. Your tendrils crossed over the sea. They reached unto the sea of Jazer.

It may have arisen from a mistaken copying of the same word in the preceding line.sn Though there is some doubt about the precise location of these places, Sibmah is generally considered to have been located slightly north and west of Heshbon and Jazer further north toward the border of Ammon not far from the city of Amman. Most commentators see the reference here (and in the parallel in Isa 16:8) to the spread of viticulture westward and northward from the vineyards of Sibmah. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G.

The ambiguity of the syntax and the apparent elliptical nature of this text makes the meaning of this verse uncertain. The Hebrew text reads: “From the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh unto Jahaz they utter their voice from Zoar unto Horonaim Eglath Shelishiyah.” The translation and interpretation here are based on interpreting the elliptical syntax here by the parallel passage in Isaiah 15:4-6 where cries of anguish rise from Heshbon and Elealeh which are heard all the way to Jahaz. The people flee southward arriving at Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah where they voice the news of the destruction in the north. Hence, the present translation interprets the phrase “from the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh” to be parallel to “Heshbon and Elealeh cry out” and take the preposition “from” with the verb “they utter their voice,” i.e., with the cry of Heshbon and Elealeh. The impersonal “they raise their voice” is then treated as a passive and made the subject of the whole verse. There is some debate about the identification of the waters of Nimrim. They may refer to the waters of the Wadi Nimrim which enters the Jordan about eight miles north of the Dead Sea or those of the Wadi en-Numeirah which flows into the southern tip of the Dead Sea from about ten miles south. Most commentators take the reference to be the latter because of association with Zoar. However, if the passage is talking about the destruction in the north which is reported in the south by the fleeing refugees, the reference is probably to the Wadi Nimrim in the north.sn Elealeh was about two miles (3.3 km) north of Heshbon. Jahaz was about twenty miles (33 km) south of it. These three cities were in the north and Zoar, Horonaim, and Eglath Shelishiyah were apparently in the south. The verse is speaking about the news of destruction in the north spreading to the south. Comparison should be made with the parallel passage in Isa 15:4-6.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.34" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">They will be sounded from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.34" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">For even the waters of Nimrim will be dried up.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.35" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">35</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> I will put an end in Moab</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.35" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">to those who make offerings at her places of worship.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “high place[s].” For the meaning and significance of this term see the study note on 7:31.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.35" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will put an end to those who sacrifice to other gods.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.35" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I, the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">, affirm it!</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Oracle of the Lord.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.36" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">36</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> So my heart moans for Moab</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.36" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">like a flute playing a funeral song.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.36" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Yes, like a flute playing a funeral song,</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.36" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">my heart moans for the people of Kir Heres.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.36" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">For the wealth they have gained will perish.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.37" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">37</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> For all of them will shave their heads in mourning.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.37" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">They will all cut off their beards to show their sorrow.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.37" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">They will all make gashes in their hands.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.37" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">They will all put on sackcloth.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “upon every loin [there is] sackcloth.” The word “all” is restored here before “loin” with a number of Hebrew mss and a number of versions.

They will burn up the mountain heights of those war-loving people.” The meaning of this verse is not entirely certain because of the highly figurative nature of the last two lines. The Hebrew text has been translated somewhat literally here. The Hebrew text reads: “In the shadow of Heshbon those fleeing stand without strength. For a fire goes forth from Heshbon, a flame from the midst of Sihon. And it devours the forehead of Moab and the skull of the sons of noise.” The meaning of the first part is fairly clear because v. 2 has already spoken of the conquest of Heshbon and a plot formed there to conquer the rest of the nation. The fire going forth from Heshbon would hence refer here to the conflagrations of war spreading from Heshbon to the rest of the country. The reference to the “midst of Sihon” is to be understood metonymically as a reference for the ruler to what he once ruled (cf. E. W. Bullinger, Figures of Speech, 583). The last two lines must refer to more than the fugitives who stopped at Heshbon for protection because it refers to the forehead of Moab (a personification of the whole land or nation). It is unclear, however, why reference is made to the foreheads and skulls of the Moabites, other than the fact that this verse seems to be a readaptation or reuse of Num 24:17 where the verb used with them is “smite” which fits nicely in the sense of martial destruction. Translated rather literally, it appears here to refer to the destruction by the fires of war of the Moabites, the part (forehead and skulls) put for the whole. TEV sees a reference here to the “frontiers” and “mountain heights” of Moab and this would work nicely for “foreheads” which is elsewhere used of the corner or border of a land in Neh 9:22. The word “crown” or “skull” might be a picturesque metaphor for the mountain heights of a land, but the word is never used elsewhere in such a figurative way. TEV (and CEV) which follows it might be correct here but there is no way to validate it. The meaning “war-loving people” for the phrase “sons of noise” is based on the suggestion of BDB 981 s.v. שָׁאוֹן 1 which relates the phrase to the dominant use for שָׁאוֹן (sha’on) and is adopted also by TEV, CEV, and C. von Orelli, Jeremiah, 341. REB “braggarts” and NIV “noisy boasters” seem to base the nuance on the usage of שָׁאוֹן (sha’on) in Jer 46:17 where Pharaoh is referred to as an empty noise and the reference to Moab’s arrogance and boasting in 48:29.sn This verse and the next are an apparent adaptation and reuse of a victory song in Num 21:28-29 and a prophecy in Num 24:17. That explains the reference to Sihon who was the Amorite king who captured Heshbon and proceeded from there to capture most of northern Moab (the area between Heshbon and the Arnon) which has been referred to earlier in this prophecy. This prophecy appears to speak of the destruction of Moab beginning from the same place under the picture of a destructive fire which burns up all the people. The fire is a reference to the conflagrations of war in which the enemy captures the cities and sets them on fire and burns all the people in them. What Sihon once did (Num 21:28-29) and what Balaam prophesied would happen to Moab in the future (by David? Num 24:17) are being reapplied to a new situation.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.46" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">46</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Moab, you are doomed!</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Woe to you, Moab.” For the usage of this expression see 4:13, 31; 13:17 and the translator’s note on 4:13 and 10:19.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.46" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">You people who worship Chemosh will be destroyed.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.46" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Your sons will be taken away captive.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.46" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Your daughters will be carried away into exile.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Your sons will be taken away into captivity, your daughters into exile.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.47" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">47</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Yet in days to come </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.47" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">I will reverse Moab’s ill fortune.”</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn See 29:14; 30:3 and the translator’s note on 29:14 for the idiom used here.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.47" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">says the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Oracle of the Lord.”</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="JER.48.47" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">The judgment against Moab ends here.</span></span></div>
