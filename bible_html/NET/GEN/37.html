In contrast to all the settled and expanded population of Esau, Jacob was still moving about in the land without a permanent residence and without kings. Even if the Edomite king list was added later (as the reference to kings in Israel suggests), its placement here in contrast to Jacob and his descendants is important. Certainly the text deals with Esau before dealing with Jacob – that is the pattern. But the detail is so great in chap. 36 that the contrast cannot be missed.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="GEN.37.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">2</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> This is the account of Jacob.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="GEN.37.2" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Joseph, his seventeen-year-old son,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a son of seventeen years.” The word “son” is in apposition to the name “Joseph.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> was taking care of</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Or “tending”; Heb “shepherding” or “feeding.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> the flocks with his brothers.
