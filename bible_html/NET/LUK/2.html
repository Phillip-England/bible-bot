Josephus (Ant. 18.1.1 [18.1-2]) only mentions a census in a.d. 6, too late for this setting. Such a census would have been a massive undertaking; it could have started under one ruler and emerged under another, to whose name it became attached. This is one possibility to explain the data. Another is that Quirinius, who became governor in Syria for the later census, may have been merely an administrator for this census.

Most likely Joseph and Mary sought lodging in the public accommodations in the city of Bethlehem (see J. Nolland, Luke [WBC], 1:105), which would have been crude shelters for people and animals. However, it has been suggested by various scholars that Joseph and Mary were staying with relatives in Bethlehem (e.g., C. S. Keener, The IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament, 194; B. Witherington, “Birth of Jesus,” DJG, 69-70); if that were so the term would refer to the guest room in the relatives’ house, which would have been filled beyond capacity with all the other relatives who had to journey to Bethlehem for the census.sn There was no place for them in the inn. There is no drama in how this is told. There is no search for a variety of places to stay or a heartless innkeeper. (Such items are later, nonbiblical embellishments.) Bethlehem was not large and there was simply no other place to stay. The humble surroundings of the birth are ironic in view of the birth’s significance.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">The Shepherds’ Visit</span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="LUK.2.8" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">8</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Now</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “now” to indicate the transition to a new topic.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> there were shepherds</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn Some argue that shepherds were among the culturally despised, but the evidence for this view of shepherds is late, coming from 5th century Jewish materials. December 25 as the celebrated date of Jesus’ birth arose around the time of Constantine (ca. a.d. 306-337), though it is mentioned in material from Hippolytus (a.d. 165-235). Some think that the reason for celebration on this date was that it coincided with the pagan Roman festival of Saturnalia, and Christians could celebrate their own festival at this time without fear of persecution. On the basis of the statement that the shepherds were living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night it is often suggested that Jesus’ birth took place in early spring, since it was only at lambing time that shepherds stood guard over their flocks in the field.

Some copyists, aware that the purification law applied to women only, produced mss ({76 itpt vg} [though the Latin word eius could be either masculine or feminine]) that read “her purification.” But the extant evidence for an unambiguous “her” is shut up to one late minuscule ({codex 76}) and a couple of patristic citations of dubious worth ({Pseudo-Athanasius} whose date is unknown, and the {Catenae in euangelia Lucae et Joannis}, edited by J. A. Cramer. The Catenae is a work of collected patristic sayings whose exact source is unknown [thus, it could come from a period covering hundreds of years]). A few other witnesses (D pc lat) read “his purification.” The KJV has “her purification,” following Beza’s Greek text (essentially a revision of Erasmus’). Erasmus did not have it in any of his five editions. Most likely Beza put in the feminine form αὐτῆς (auths) because, recognizing that the eius found in several Latin mss could be read either as a masculine or a feminine, he made the contextually more satisfying choice of the feminine. Perhaps it crept into one or two late Greek witnesses via this interpretive Latin back-translation. So the evidence for the feminine singular is virtually nonexistent, while the masculine singular αὐτοῦ (autou, “his”) was a clear scribal blunder. There can be no doubt that “their purification” is the authentic reading.tn Or “when the days of their purification were completed.” In addition to the textual problem concerning the plural pronoun (which apparently includes Joseph in the process) there is also a question whether the term translated “purification” (καθαρισμός, kaqarismo&#34;) refers to the time period prescribed by the Mosaic law or to the offering itself which marked the end of the time period (cf. NLT, “it was time for the purification offering”).sn Exegetically the plural pronoun “their” creates a problem. It was Mary’s purification that was required by law, forty days after the birth (Lev 12:2-4). However, it is possible that Joseph shared in a need to be purified by having to help with the birth or that they also dedicated the child as a first born (Exod 13:2), which would also require a sacrifice that Joseph would bring. Luke’s point is that the parents followed the law. They were pious.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Grk “they”; the referents (Joseph and Mary) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> brought Jesus</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Grk “him”; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> up to Jerusalem</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> to present him to the Lord </span></span><span data-usfm="LUK.2.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">23</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> (just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “</span><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Every firstborn male</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Grk “every male that opens the womb” (an idiom for the firstborn male).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> will be set apart to the Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">”</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn An allusion to Exod 13:2, 12, 15.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">), </span></span><span data-usfm="LUK.2.24" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">24</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord, </span><span class="ChapterContent_bd__FCGnY"><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">a pair of doves</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn The offering of a pair of doves or two young pigeons, instead of a lamb, speaks of the humble roots of Jesus’ family – they apparently could not afford the expense of a lamb.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_bd__FCGnY"><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> or two young pigeons</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Lev 12:8; 5:11 (LXX).</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">The Prophecy of Simeon</span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="LUK.2.25" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">25</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Now</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Grk “And behold.” Here καί (kai) has been translated as “now” to indicate the transition to a new topic.
