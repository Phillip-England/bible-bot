Since he or she had been declared “unclean” by a priest (Lev 13:3) and was, therefore, required to remain outside the camp (13:46), the formerly diseased person could not reenter the camp until he or she had been declared “clean” by a priest (cf. Lev 13:6 for “declaring clean.”). See especially J. Milgrom, Leviticus (AB), 1:831, who supports this rendering both here and in Lev 13:2 and 9. B. A. Levine, however, prefers the rendering in the text (Leviticus [JPSTC], 76 and 85). It is the most natural meaning of the verb (i.e., “to be brought” from בּוֹא [bo’, “to come”] in the Hophal stem, which means “to be brought” in all other occurrences in Leviticus other than 13:2, 9, and 14:2; see only 6:30; 10:18; 11:32; and 16:27), it suits the context well in 13:2, and the rendering “to be brought” is supported by 13:7b, “he shall show himself to the priest a second time.” Although it is true that the priest needed to go outside the camp to examine such a person, the person still needed to “be brought” to the priest there. The translation of vv. 2-3 employed here suggests that v. 2 introduces the proceeding and then v. 3 goes on to describe the specific details of the examination and purification.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="LEV.14.3" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">3</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The priest is to go outside the camp and examine the infection.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he shall be brought to the priest and the priest shall go out to from outside to the camp and the priest shall see [it].” The understood “it” refers to the skin infection itself (see the note on 13:3 above).

This particular “worm” is an insect that lives on the leaves of palm trees, the eggs of which are the source for a “crimson” dye used to color various kinds of cloth (B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 86). That a kind of dyed “fabric” is intended, not just the dye substance itself, is made certain by the dipping of it along with the other ritual materials listed here into the blood and water mixture for sprinkling on the person being cleansed (Lev 14:6; cf. also the burning of it in the fire of the red heifer in Num 19:6). Both the reddish color of cedar wood and the crimson colored fabric seem to correspond to the color of blood and may, therefore, symbolize either “life,” which is in the blood, or the use of blood to “make atonement” (see, e.g., Gen 9:4 and Lev 17:11).

E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 195), were particularly leafy and therefore especially useful for sprinkling the purifying liquid (cf. vv. 5-7). Many of the details of the ritual procedure are obscure. It has been proposed, for example, that the “cedar wood” was a stick to which the hyssop was bound with the crimson material to make a sort of sprinkling instrument (Hartley, 195). In light of the burning of these three materials as part of the preparation of the ashes of the red heifer in Num 19:5-6, however, this seems unlikely.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> be taken up</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn The MT reads literally, “And the priest shall command and he shall take.” Clearly, the second verb (“and he shall take”) contains the thrust of the priest’s command, which suggests the translation “that he take” (cf. also v. 5a). Since the priest issues the command here, he cannot be the subject of the second verb because he cannot be commanding himself to “take” up these ritual materials. Moreover, since the ritual is being performed “for the one being cleansed,” the antecedent of the pronoun “he” cannot refer to him. The LXX, Smr, and Syriac versions have the third person plural here and in v. 5a, which corresponds to other combinations with the verb וְצִוָּה (vÿtsivvah) “and he (the priest) shall command” in this context (see Lev 13:54; 14:36, 40). This suggests an impersonal (i.e., “someone shall take” and “someone shall slaughter,” respectively) or perhaps even passive rendering of the verbs in 14:4, 5 (i.e., “there shall be taken” and “there shall be slaughtered,” respectively). The latter option has been chosen here.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> for the one being cleansed.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the one cleansing himself” (i.e., Hitpael participle of טָהֵר, taher, “to be clean”).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="LEV.14.5" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">5</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The priest will then command that one bird be slaughtered</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And the priest shall command and he shall slaughter.” See the note on “be taken up” (v. 4).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> into a clay vessel over fresh water.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “into a vessel of clay over living water.” The expression “living [i.e., ‘fresh’] water” (cf. Lev 14:50; 15:13; Num 19:17) refers to water that flows. It includes such water sources as artesian wells (Gen 26:19; Song of Songs 4:15), springs (Jer 2:13, as opposed to cisterns; cf. 17:13), and flowing streams (Zech 14:8). In other words, this is water that has not stood stagnant as, for example, in a sealed-off cistern. sn Although there are those who argue that the water and the blood rites are separate (e.g., E. S. Gerstenberger, Leviticus [OTL], 175-76), it is usually agreed that v. 5b refers to the slaughtering of the bird in such a way that its blood runs into the bowl, which contained fresh water (see, e.g., N. H. Snaith, Leviticus and Numbers [NCBC], 74; G. J. Wenham, Leviticus [NICOT], 208; J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:836-38; cf. esp. Lev 14:51b, “and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and in the fresh water”).

This contrasts with the fear of death associated with the serious skin diseases in view here (see, e.g., Aaron’s description of Miriam’s skin disease in Num 12:12, “Do not let her be like the dead one when it goes out from its mother’s womb and its flesh half eaten away”). Since the slaughtered bird here is not sacrificed at the altar and is not designated as an expiatory “sin offering,” this ritual procedure probably symbolizes the renewed life of the diseased person and displays it publicly for all to see. It is preparatory to the expiatory rituals that will follow (vv. 10-20, esp. vv. 18-20), but is not itself expiatory. Thus, although there are important similarities between the bird ritual here, the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:20-22), and the red heifer for cleansing from corpse contamination (Num 19), this bird ritual is different in that the latter two constitute “sin offerings” (Lev 16:5, 8-10; Num 19:9, 17). Neither of the birds in Lev 14:4-7 is designated or treated as a “sin offering.” Nevertheless, the very nature of the live bird ritual itself and its obvious similarity to the scapegoat ritual suggests that the patient’s disease has been removed far away so that he or she is free from its effects both personally and communally.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">The Seven Days of Purification</span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="LEV.14.8" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">8</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> “The one being cleansed</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the one cleansing himself” (i.e., Hitpael participle of טָהֵר [taher, “to be clean”]).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> must then wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe in water, and so be clean.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he shall be clean” (so ASV).

There are, however, further cleansing rituals and pronouncements for him to undergo in the tabernacle as outlined in vv. 10-20 (see Qal “be[come] clean” in vv. 9 and 20, Piel “pronounce clean” in v. 11, and Hitpael “the one being cleansed” in vv. 11, 14, 17, 18, and 19).

Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:179; see the note on Lev 2:1). The unit of measure is most certainly an “ephah” even though it is not stated explicitly (see, e.g., Num 28:5; cf. 15:4, 6, 8), and three-tenths of an ephah would amount to about a gallon, or perhaps one-third of a bushel (J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 196; Milgrom, 845). Since the normal amount of flour for a lamb is one-tenth of an ephah (Num 28:4-5; cf. 15:4), three-tenths is about right for the three lambs offered in Lev 14:10-20.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> and one log of olive oil,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn A “log” (לֹג, log) of oil is about one-sixth of a liter, or one-third of a pint, or two-thirds of a cup.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="LEV.14.11" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">11</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> and the priest who pronounces him clean will have the man who is being cleansed stand along with these offerings</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn The MT here is awkward to translate into English.

Alternatively, the Piel of טָהֵר could be rendered “who performs the cleansing/purification” (J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:827), perhaps even as a technical term for one who holds the office of “purification priest” (B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 87).

It is, therefore, closely associated with the reconsecration of the Lord’s holy people as, for example, here and in the case of the corpse contaminated Nazirite (Num 6:11b-12). Since the nation of Israel was “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” to the Lord (Exod 19:6; cf. the blood splashed on all the people in Exod 24:8), the skin diseased person was essentially a member of the “holy nation” who had been expelled from the community. Therefore, he or she had been desecrated and the guilt offering was essential to restoring him or her to the community. In fact, the manipulation of blood and oil in the guilt offering ritual procedure for the healed person (see vv. 14-18 below) is reminiscent of that employed for the ordination offering in the consecration of the holy Aaronic priests of the nation (Exod 29:19-21; Lev 8:22-30).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> along with the log of olive oil and present them as a wave offering before the </span><span class="ChapterContent_sc__Hg9da"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">Lord</span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Heb “wave them [as] a wave offering before the Lord” (NAB similar).
