At that point the son would have placed his father’s bones in a special box known as an ossuary to be set into the wall of the tomb. Thus Jesus could well be rebuking the man for wanting to wait around for as much as a year before making a commitment to follow him. In 1st century Jewish culture, to have followed Jesus rather than burying one’s father would have seriously dishonored one’s father (cf. Tobit 4:3-4). (2) The remark is an idiom (possibly a proverbial saying) that means, “The matter in question is not the real issue,” in which case Jesus was making a wordplay on the wording of the man’s (literal) request (see L&amp;N 33.137). (3) This remark could be a figurative reference to various kinds of people, meaning, “Let the spiritually dead bury the dead.” (4) It could also be literal and designed to shock the hearer by the surprise of the contrast. Whichever option is preferred, it is clear that the most important priority is to follow Jesus.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">Stilling of a Storm </span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="MAT.8.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">23</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn A boat that held all the disciples would be of significant size.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="MAT.8.24" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">24</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat.

A number of mss (B C [Δ] Θ al sys,p,h) read “Gadarenes,” which is the better reading here. Many other mss (א2 L W Ë1,13 Ï [syhmg] bo) have “Gergesenes.” Others (892c latt syhmg sa mae) have “Gerasenes,” which is the reading followed in Luke 8:26. The difference between Matthew and Luke may be due to uses of variant regional terms. sn The region of the Gadarenes would be in Gentile territory on the southeastern side of the Sea of Galilee across from Galilee. Luke 8:26 and Mark 5:1 record this miracle as occurring “in the region of the Gerasenes.” “Irrespective of how one settles this issue, for the [second and] Third Evangelist the chief concern is that Jesus has crossed over into Gentile territory, ‘opposite Galilee’” (J. B. Green, Luke [NICNT], 337). The region of Gadara extended to the Sea of Galilee and included the town of Sennabris on the southern shore – the town that the herdsmen most likely entered after the drowning of the pigs.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him.

The phrase τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοί (ti Jhmin kai soi) is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BDAG 275 s.v. ἐγώ). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say “What to me and to you?” meaning, “What have I done to you that you should do this to me?” (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, “What to me and to you?” meaning, “That is your business, how am I involved?” (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone! Never mind! Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: “Leave us alone….”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Have you come here to torment us before the time?”</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">sn There was an appointed time in which demons would face their judgment, and they seem to have viewed Jesus’ arrival on the scene as an illegitimate change in God’s plan regarding the time when their sentence would be executed.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="MAT.8.30" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">30</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> A</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Here δέ (de) has not been translated.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them. </span></span><span data-usfm="MAT.8.31" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">31</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Then the demons begged him,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Grk “asked him, saying.” The participle λέγοντες (legontes) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” </span></span><span data-usfm="MAT.8.32" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">32</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> And he said,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Grk “And he said to them.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> “Go!” So</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Here δέ (de) has been translated as “so” to indicate a conclusion and transition in the narrative.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> they came out and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water. </span></span><span data-usfm="MAT.8.33" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">33</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Here δέ (de) has not been translated.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> herdsmen ran off, went into the town,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Or “city.” But see the sn on “Gadarenes” in 8:28.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men. </span></span><span data-usfm="MAT.8.34" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">34</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Then</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “then” to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.
