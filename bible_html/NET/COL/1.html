BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is “bondservant” (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another.

Although it is possible that ἡμῶν was an early alteration of ὑμῶν (either unintentionally, as dittography, since it comes seventeen letters after the previous ἡμῶν; or intentionally, to conform to the surrounding first person pronouns), this supposition is difficult to maintain in light of the varied and valuable witnesses for this reading. Further, the second person is both embedded in the verb ἐμάθετε (emaqete) and is explicit in v. 8 (ὑμῶν). Hence, the motivation to change to the first person pronoun is counterbalanced by such evidence. The second person pronoun may have been introduced unintentionally via homoioarcton with the ὑπέρ (Juper) that immediately precedes it. As well, the second person reading is somewhat harder for it seems to address Epaphras’ role only in relation to Paul and his colleagues, rather than in relation to the Colossians. Nevertheless, the decision must be based ultimately on external evidence (because the internal evidence can be variously interpreted), and this strongly supports ἡμῶν.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> behalf – </span></span><span data-usfm="COL.1.8" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">8</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">Paul’s Prayer for the Growth of the Church</span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="COL.1.9" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">9</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> For this reason we also, from the day we heard about you,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Or “heard about it”; Grk “heard.” There is no direct object stated in the Greek (direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context).

In light of this uncertainty, other translations supply “about you” (TEV, NIV, CEV, NLT).

These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: “(a) stylistic: a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of parallelismus membrorum (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, chiasmus, and antithesis; and (b) linguistic: an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context” (P. T. O’Brien, Philippians [NIGTC], 188-89). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation.

M. J. Harris, Colossians and Philemon (EGGNT), 43, expresses the meaning of the word well: “The ‘firstborn’ was either the eldest child in a family or a person of preeminent rank. The use of this term to describe the Davidic king in Ps 88:28 LXX (=Ps 89:27 EVV), ‘I will also appoint him my firstborn (πρωτότοκον), the most exalted of the kings of the earth,’ indicates that it can denote supremacy in rank as well as priority in time. But whether the πρωτό- element in the word denotes time, rank, or both, the significance of the -τοκος element as indicating birth or origin (from τίκτω, give birth to) has been virtually lost except in ref. to lit. birth.” In Col 1:15 the emphasis is on the priority of Jesus’ rank as over and above creation (cf. 1:16 and the “for” clause referring to Jesus as Creator).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> over all creation,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn The genitive construction πάσης κτίσεως (pash&#34; ktisew&#34;) is a genitive of subordination and is therefore translated as “over all creation.” See ExSyn 103-4.</span></span></span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="COL.1.16" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">16</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him – all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn BDAG 579 s.v. κυριότης 3 suggests “bearers of the ruling powers, dominions” here.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> whether principalities or powers – all things were created through him and for him.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="COL.1.17" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">17</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> He himself is before all things and all things are held together</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn BDAG 973 s.v. συνίστημι B.3 suggests “continue, endure, exist, hold together” here.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> in him.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="COL.1.18" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">18</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> He is the head of the body, the church, as well as the beginning, the firstborn</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn See the note on the term “firstborn” in 1:15.

External evidence is fairly evenly divided. Many ancient and excellent witnesses lack the phrase (B D* F G I 0278 81 1175 1739 1881 2464 al latt sa), but equally important witnesses have it (Ì46 א A C D1 Ψ 048vid 33 Ï). Both readings have strong Alexandrian support, which makes the problem difficult to decide on external evidence alone. Internal evidence points to the inclusion of the phrase as original. The word immediately preceding the phrase is the masculine pronoun αὐτοῦ (autou); thus the possibility of omission through homoioteleuton in various witnesses is likely. Scribes might have deleted the phrase because of perceived redundancy or awkwardness in the sense: The shorter reading is smoother and more elegant, so scribes would be prone to correct the text in that direction. As far as style is concerned, repetition of key words and phrases for emphasis is not foreign to the corpus Paulinum (see, e.g., Rom 8:23, Eph 1:13, 2 Cor 12:7). In short, it is easier to account for the shorter reading arising from the longer reading than vice versa, so the longer reading is more likely original.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> whether things on earth or things in heaven.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_s1__bNNaW"><span class="ChapterContent_heading__xBDcs">Paul’s Goal in Ministry</span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="COL.1.21" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">21</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> And you were at one time strangers and enemies in your</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn The article τῇ (th) has been translated as a possessive pronoun (ExSyn 215).</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> minds</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Although διανοία (dianoia) is singular in Greek, the previous plural noun ἐχθρούς (ecqrous) indicates that all those from Colossae are in view here.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> as expressed through</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn The dative ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τοῖς πονηροῖς (en toi&#34; ergoi&#34; toi&#34; ponhroi&#34;) is taken as means, indicating the avenue through which hostility in the mind is revealed and made known.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> your evil deeds, </span></span><span data-usfm="COL.1.22" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">22</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> but now he has reconciled you</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tc Some of the better representatives of the Alexandrian and Western texts have a passive verb here instead of the active ἀποκατήλλαξεν (apokathllaxen, “he has reconciled”): ἀποκατηλλάγητε (apokathllaghte) in (Ì46) B, ἀποκατήλλακται [sic] (apokathllaktai) in 33, and ἀποκαταλλαγέντες (apokatallagente&#34;) in D* F G. Yet the active verb is strongly supported by א A C D2 Ψ 048 075 [0278] 1739 1881 Ï lat sy. Internally, the passive creates an anacoluthon in that it looks back to the accusative ὑμᾶς (Juma&#34;, “you”) of v. 21 and leaves the following παραστῆσαι (parasthsai) dangling (“you were reconciled…to present you”). The passive reading is certainly the harder reading. As such, it may well explain the rise of the other readings. At the same time, it is possible that the passive was produced by scribes who wanted some symmetry between the ποτε (pote, “at one time”) of v. 21 and the νυνὶ δέ (nuni de, “but now”) of v. 22: Since a passive periphrastic participle is used in v. 21, there may have a temptation to produce a corresponding passive form in v. 22, handling the ὑμᾶς of v. 21 by way of constructio ad sensum. Since παραστῆσαι occurs ten words later, it may not have been considered in this scribal modification. Further, the Western reading (ἀποκαταλλαγέντες) hardly seems to have arisen from ἀποκατηλλάγητε (contra TCGNT 555). As difficult as this decision is, the preferred reading is the active form because it is superior externally and seems to explain the rise of all forms of the passive readings.tn The direct object is omitted in the Greek text, but it is clear from context that “you” (ὑμᾶς, Jumas) is implied.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_it__p_cmC"><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless before him – </span></span><span data-usfm="COL.1.23" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">23</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> if indeed you remain in the faith, established and firm,</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn BDAG 276 s.v. ἑδραῖος suggests “firm, steadfast.”</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> without shifting</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn BDAG 639 s.v. μετακινέω suggests “without shifting from the hope” here.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> from the hope of the gospel that you heard.
