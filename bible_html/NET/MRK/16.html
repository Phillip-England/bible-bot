The following shorter ending is found in some mss: “They reported briefly to those around Peter all that they had been commanded. After these things Jesus himself sent out through them, from the east to the west, the holy and imperishable preaching of eternal salvation. Amen.” This shorter ending is usually included with the longer ending (L Ψ 083 099 0112 579 al); k, however, ends at this point. Most mss include the longer ending (vv. 9-20) immediately after v. 8 (A C D W [which has a different shorter ending between vv. 14 and 15] Θ Ë13 33 2427 Ï lat syc,p,h bo); however, Jerome and Eusebius knew of almost no Greek mss that had this ending. Several mss have marginal comments noting that earlier Greek mss lacked the verses, while others mark the text with asterisks or obeli (symbols that scribes used to indicate that the portion of text being copied was spurious). Internal evidence strongly suggests the secondary nature of both the short and the long endings. Their vocabulary and style are decidedly non-Markan (for further details, see TCGNT 102-6). All of this evidence strongly suggests that as time went on scribes added the longer ending, either for the richness of its material or because of the abruptness of the ending at v. 8. (Indeed, the strange variety of dissimilar endings attests to the probability that early copyists had a copy of Mark that ended at v. 8, and they filled out the text with what seemed to be an appropriate conclusion. All of the witnesses for alternative endings to vv. 9-20 thus indirectly confirm the Gospel as ending at v. 8.) Because of such problems regarding the authenticity of these alternative endings, 16:8 is usually regarded as the last verse of the Gospel of Mark. There are three possible explanations for Mark ending at 16:8: (1) The author intentionally ended the Gospel here in an open-ended fashion; (2) the Gospel was never finished; or (3) the last leaf of the ms was lost prior to copying. This first explanation is the most likely due to several factors, including (a) the probability that the Gospel was originally written on a scroll rather than a codex (only on a codex would the last leaf get lost prior to copying); (b) the unlikelihood of the ms not being completed; and (c) the literary power of ending the Gospel so abruptly that the readers are now drawn into the story itself. E. Best aptly states, “It is in keeping with other parts of his Gospel that Mark should not give an explicit account of a conclusion where this is already well known to his readers” (Mark, 73; note also his discussion of the ending of this Gospel on 132 and elsewhere). The readers must now ask themselves, “What will I do with Jesus? If I do not accept him in his suffering, I will not see him in his glory.”sn Double brackets have been placed around this passage to indicate that most likely it was not part of the original text of the Gospel of Mark. In spite of this, the passage has an important role in the history of the transmission of the text, so it has been included in the translation.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">[[ </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.9" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">9</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons. </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.10" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">10</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> She went out and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.11" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">11</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.</span></span></div><div class="ChapterContent_p__dVKHb"><span data-usfm="MRK.16.12" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">12</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> After this he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were on their way to the country. </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.13" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">13</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> They went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.14" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">14</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> Then he appeared to the eleven themselves, while they were eating, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected. </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.15" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">15</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.16" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">16</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who does not believe will be condemned. </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.16.17" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">17</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> These signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;</span><span class="ChapterContent_note__YlDW0"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">#</span><span class="ChapterContent_body__O3qjr"><span class="ft">tn Grk “tongues,” though the word is used figuratively (perhaps as a metonymy of cause for effect).
