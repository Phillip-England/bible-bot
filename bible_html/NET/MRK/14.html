The Passover lamb was roasted and eaten after sunset in a family group of at least ten people (m. Pesahim 7.13). People ate the meal while reclining (see the note on table in 14:18). It included, besides the lamb, unleavened bread and bitter herbs as a reminder of Israel’s bitter affliction at the hands of the Egyptians.

The omission could have been intentional on the part of some Alexandrian scribes who wished to bring this text in line with the other Gospel accounts that only mention a rooster crowing once (Matt 26:74; Luke 22:60; John 18:27). The insertion could be an attempt to make the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy in 14:30 more explicit. Internally, the words “and a rooster crowed” fit Mark’s Gospel here, not only in view of 14:30, “before a rooster crows twice,” but also in view of the mention of “a second time” in 14:71 (a reading which is much more textually secure). Nevertheless, a decision is difficult.tn A real rooster crowing is probably in view here (rather than the Roman trumpet call known as gallicinium), in part due to the fact that Mark mentions the rooster crowing twice. See the discussion at Matt 26:74.</span></span></span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA">  </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.14.69" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">69</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> When the slave girl saw him, she began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.” </span></span><span data-usfm="MRK.14.70" class="ChapterContent_verse__57FIw"><span class="ChapterContent_label__R2PLt">70</span><span class="ChapterContent_content__RrUqA"> But he denied it again.
